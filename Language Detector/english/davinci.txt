preface
a singular fatality has ruled the destiny of nearly all the most
famous of leonardo da vincis works two of the three most important
were never completed obstacles having arisen during his lifetime
which obliged him to leave them unfinished namely the sforza
monument and the wallpainting of the battle of anghiari while the
thirdthe picture of the last supper at milanhas suffered
irremediable injury from decay and the repeated restorations to
which it was recklessly subjected during the xviith and xviiith
centuries nevertheless no other picture of the renaissance has
become so wellknown and popular through copies of every description
vasari says and rightly in his life of leonardo that he laboured
much more by his word than in fact or by deed and the biographer
evidently had in his mind the numerous works in manuscript which
have been preserved to this day to us now it seems almost
inexplicable that these valuable and interesting original texts
should have remained so long unpublished and indeed forgotten it
is certain that during the xvith and xviith centuries their
exceptional value was highly appreciated this is proved not merely
by the prices which they commanded but also by the exceptional
interest which has been attached to the change of ownership of
merely a few pages of manuscript
that notwithstanding this eagerness to possess the manuscripts
their contents remained a mystery can only be accounted for by the
many and great difficulties attending the task of deciphering them
the handwriting is so peculiar that it requires considerable
practice to read even a few detached phrases much more to solve
with any certainty the numerous difficulties of alternative
readings and to master the sense as a connected whole vasari
observes with reference to leonardos writing he wrote backwards
in rude characters and with the left hand so that any one who is
not practised in reading them cannot understand them the aid of a
mirror in reading reversed handwriting appears to me available only
for a first experimental reading speaking from my own experience
the persistent use of it is too fatiguing and inconvenient to be
practically advisable considering the enormous mass of manuscripts
to be deciphered and as after all leonardos handwriting runs
backwards just as all oriental character runs backwardsthat is
to say from right to leftthe difficulty of reading direct from the
writing is not insuperable this obvious peculiarity in the writing
is not however by any means the only obstacle in the way of
mastering the text leonardo made use of an orthography peculiar to
himself he had a fashion of amalgamating several short words into
one long one or again he would quite arbitrarily divide a long
word into two separate halves added to this there is no punctuation
whatever to regulate the division and construction of the sentences
nor are there any accentsand the reader may imagine that such
difficulties were almost sufficient to make the task seem a
desperate one to a beginner it is therefore not surprising that the
good intentions of some of leonardo s most reverent admirers should
have failed
leonardos literary labours in various departments both of art and of
science were those essentially of an enquirer hence the analytical
method is that which he employs in arguing out his investigations
and dissertations the vast structure of his scientific theories is
consequently built up of numerous separate researches and it is
much to be lamented that he should never have collated and arranged
them his love for detailed researchas it seems to mewas the
reason that in almost all the manuscripts the different paragraphs
appear to us to be in utter confusion on one and the same page
observations on the most dissimilar subjects follow each other
without any connection a page for instance will begin with some
principles of astronomy or the motion of the earth then come the
laws of sound and finally some precepts as to colour another page
will begin with his investigations on the structure of the
intestines and end with philosophical remarks as to the relations
of poetry to painting and so forth
leonardo himself lamented this confusion and for that reason i do
not think that the publication of the texts in the order in which
they occur in the originals would at all fulfil his intentions no
reader could find his way through such a labyrinth leonardo himself
could not have done it
added to this more than half of the five thousand manuscript pages
which now remain to us are written on loose leaves and at present
arranged in a manner which has no justification beyond the fancy of
the collector who first brought them together to make volumes of
more or less extent nay even in the volumes the pages of which
were numbered by leonardo himself their order so far as the
connection of the texts was concerned was obviously a matter of
indifference to him the only point he seems to have kept in view
when first writing down his notes was that each observation should
be complete to the end on the page on which it was begun the
exceptions to this rule are extremely few and it is certainly
noteworthy that we find in such cases in bound volumes with his
numbered pages the written observations turn over this is the
continuation of the previous page and the like is not this
sufficient to prove that it was only in quite exceptional cases that
the writer intended the consecutive pages to remain connected when
he should at last carry out the often planned arrangement of his
writings
what this final arrangement was to be leonardo has in most cases
indicated with considerable completeness in other cases this
authoritative clue is wanting but the difficulties arising from
this are not insuperable for as the subject of the separate
paragraphs is always distinct and well defined in itself it is
quite possible to construct a wellplanned whole out of the
scattered materials of his scientific system and i may venture to
state that i have devoted especial care and thought to the due
execution of this responsible task
the beginning of leonardos literary labours dates from about his
thirtyseventh year and he seems to have carried them on without
any serious interruption till his death thus the manuscripts that
remain represent a period of about thirty years within this space
of time his handwriting altered so little that it is impossible to
judge from it of the date of any particular text the exact dates
indeed can only be assigned to certain notebooks in which the year
is incidentally indicated and in which the order of the leaves has
not been altered since leonardo used them the assistance these
afford for a chronological arrangement of the manuscripts is
generally self evident by this clue i have assigned to the original
manuscripts now scattered through england italy and france the
order of their production as in many matters of detail it is highly
important to be able to verify the time and place at which certain
observations were made and registered for this purpose the
bibliography of the manuscripts given at the end of vol ii may be
regarded as an index not far short of complete of all leonardo s
literary works now extant the consecutive numbers from 1 to 1566
at the head of each passage in this work indicate their logical
sequence with reference to the subjects while the letters and
figures to the left of each paragraph refer to the original
manuscript and number of the page on which that particular passage
is to be found thus the reader by referring to the list of
manuscripts at the beginning of volume i and to the bibliography at
the end of volume ii can in every instance easily ascertain not
merely the period to which the passage belongs but also exactly
where it stood in the original document thus too by following the
sequence of the numbers in the bibliographical index the reader may
reconstruct the original order of the manuscripts and recompose the
various texts to be found on the original sheetsso much of it
that is to say as by its subjectmatter came within the scope of
this work it may however be here observed that leonardo s
manuscripts contain besides the passages here printed a great
number of notes and dissertations on mechanics physics and some
other subjects many of which could only be satisfactorily dealt
with by specialists i have given as complete a review of these
writings as seemed necessary in the bibliographical notes
in 1651 raphael trichet dufresne of paris published a selection
from leonardos writings on painting and this treatise became so
popular that it has since been reprinted about twoandtwenty times
and in six different languages but none of these editions were
derived from the original texts which were supposed to have been
lost but from early copies in which leonardos text had been more
or less mutilated and which were all fragmentary the oldest and on
the whole the best copy of leonardos essays and precepts on
painting is in the vatican library this has been twice printed
first by manzi in 1817 and secondly by ludwig in 1882 still
this ancient copy and the published editions of it contain much
for which it would be rash to hold leonardo responsible and some
portionssuch as the very important rules for the proportions of
the human figureare wholly wanting on the other hand they contain
passages which if they are genuine cannot now be verified from any
original manuscript extant these copies at any rate neither give
us the original order of the texts as written by leonardo nor do
they afford any substitute by connecting them on a rational scheme
indeed in their chaotic confusion they are anything rather than
satisfactory reading the fault no doubt rests with the compiler
of the vatican copy which would seem to be the source whence all
the published and extensively known texts were derived for instead
of arranging the passages himself he was satisfied with recording a
suggestion for a final arrangement of them into eight distinct
parts without attempting to carry out his scheme under the
mistaken idea that this plan of distribution might be that not of
the compiler but of leonardo himself the various editors down to
the present day have very injudiciously continued to adopt this
orderor rather disorder
i like other enquirers had given up the original manuscript of the
trattato della pittura for lost till in the beginning of 1880 i
was enabled by the liberality of lord ashburnham to inspect his
manuscripts and was so happy as to discover among them the original
text of the bestknown portion of the trattato in his magnificent
library at ashburnham place though this discovery was of a fragment
onlybut a considerable fragmentinciting me to further search
it gave the key to the mystery which had so long enveloped the first
origin of all the known copies of the trattato the extensive
researches i was subsequently enabled to prosecute and the results
of which are combined in this work were only rendered possible by
the unrestricted permission granted me to investigate all the
manuscripts by leonardo dispersed throughout europe and to
reproduce the highly important original sketches they contain by
the process of photogravure her majesty the queen graciously
accorded me special permission to copy for publication the
manuscripts at the royal library at windsor the commission centrale
administrative de linstitut de france paris gave me in the most
liberal manner in answer to an application from sir frederic
leighton p r a corresponding member of the institut free
permission to work for several months in their private collection at
deciphering the manuscripts preserved there the same favour which
lord ashburnham had already granted me was extended to me by the
earl of leicester the marchese trivulsi and the curators of the
ambrosian library at milan by the conte manzoni at rome and by
other private owners of manuscripts of leonardos as also by the
directors of the louvre at paris the accademia at venice the
uffizi at florence the royal library at turin and the british
museum and the south kensington museum i am also greatly indebted
to the librarians of these various collections for much assistance
in my labours and more particularly to monsieur louis lalanne of
the institut de france the abbate ceriani of the ambrosian
library mr maude thompson keeper of manuscripts at the british
museum mr holmes the queens librarian at windsor the revd vere
bayne librarian of christ church college at oxford and the revd a
napier librarian to the earl of leicester at holkham hall
in correcting the italian text for the press i have had the
advantage of valuable advice from the commendatore giov morelli
senatore del regno and from signor gustavo frizzoni of milan the
translation under many difficulties of the italian text into
english is mainly due to mrs r c bell while the rendering of
several of the most puzzling and important passages particularly in
the second half of vol i i owe to the indefatigable interest taken
in this work by mr e j poynter r a finally i must express my
thanks to mr alfred marks of long ditton who has most kindly
assisted me throughout in the revision of the proof sheets
the notes and dissertations on the texts on architecture in vol ii
i owe to my friend baron henri de geymuller of paris
i may further mention with regard to the illustrations that the
negatives for the production of the photogravures by monsieur
dujardin of paris were all taken direct from the originals
it is scarcely necessary to add that most of the drawings here
reproduced in facsimile have never been published before as i am
now on the termination of a work of several years duration in a
position to review the general tenour of leonardos writings i may
perhaps be permitted to add a word as to my own estimate of the
value of their contents i have already shown that it is due to
nothing but a fortuitous succession of unfortunate circumstances
that we should not long since have known leonardo not merely as a
painter but as an author a philosopher and a naturalist there
can be no doubt that in more than one department his principles and
discoveries were infinitely more in accord with the teachings of
modern science than with the views of his contemporaries for this
reason his extraordinary gifts and merits are far more likely to be
appreciated in our own time than they could have been during the
preceding centuries he has been unjustly accused of having
squandered his powers by beginning a variety of studies and then
having hardly begun throwing them aside the truth is that the
labours of three centuries have hardly sufficed for the elucidation
of some of the problems which occupied his mighty mind
alexander von humboldt has borne witness that he was the first to
start on the road towards the point where all the impressions of our
senses converge in the idea of the unity of nature nay yet more
may be said the very words which are inscribed on the monument of
alexander von humboldt himself at berlin are perhaps the most
appropriate in which we can sum up our estimate of leonardos

that had gone before and all the more since the intervals are long

of digging a canal put this in the book of useful inventions and in
proving them bring forward the propositions already proved and this
is the proper order since if you wished to show the usefulness of
any plan you would be obliged again to devise new machines to prove
its utility and thus would confuse the order of the forty books and
also the order of the diagrams that is to say you would have to mix
up practice with theory which would produce a confused and
incoherent work

seeing that i can find no subject specially useful or
pleasingsince the men who have come before me have taken for their
own every useful or necessary themei must do like one who being
poor comes last to the fair and can find no other way of providing
himself than by taking all the things already seen by other buyers
and not taken but refused by reason of their lesser value i then
will load my humble pack with this despised and rejected
merchandise the refuse of so many buyers and will go about to
distribute it not indeed in great cities but in the poorer towns
taking such a price as the wares i offer may be worth footnote it
need hardly be pointed out that there is in this proemio a covert
irony in the second and third prefaces leonardo characterises his
rivals and opponents more closely his protest is directed against
neolatinism as professed by most of the humanists of his time its
futility is now no longer questioned

i know that many will call this useless work footnote 3 questa
essere opera inutile by opera we must here understand libro di
pittura and particularly the treatise on perspective and they
will be those of whom demetrius footnote 4 demetrio with regard
to the passage attributed to demetrius dr h muller strubing
writes i know not what to make of it it is certainly not
demetrius phalereus that is meant and it can hardly be demetrius
poliorcetes who then can it befor the name is a very common one
it may be a clerical error for demades and the maxim is quite in the
spirit of his writings i have not however been able to find any
corresponding passage either in the fragments c muller orat
att ii 441 nor in the supplements collected by dietz rhein
mus vol 29 p 108
the same passage occurs as a simple memorandum in the ms tr 57
apparently as a note for this proemio thus affording some data
as to the time where these introductions were written declared
that he took no more account of the wind that came out their mouth
in words than of that they expelled from their lower parts men who
desire nothing but material riches and are absolutely devoid of that
of wisdom which is the food and the only true riches of the mind
for so much more worthy as the soul is than the body so much more
noble are the possessions of the soul than those of the body and
often when i see one of these men take this work in his hand i
wonder that he does not put it to his nose like a monkey or ask me
if it is something good to eat

introduction
i am fully concious that not being a literary man certain
presumptuous persons will think that they may reasonably blame me
alleging that i am not a man of letters foolish folks do they not
know that i might retort as marius did to the roman patricians
footnote 21 come mario disse ai patriti romani i am unable to
find the words here attributed by leonardo to marius either in
plutarchs life of marius or in the apophthegmata moralia
p202 nor do they occur in the writings of valerius maximus who
frequently mentions marius nor in velleius paterculus ii 11 to
43 dio cassius aulus gellius or macrobius professor e
mendelson of dorpat the editor of herodian assures me that no such
passage is the found in that author communication from dr muller
strubing leonardo evidently meant to allude to some well known
incident in roman history and the mention of marius is the result
probably of some confusion we may perhaps read for marius
menenius agrippa though in that case it is true we must alter
patriti to plebei the change is a serious one but it would render
the passage perfectly clear by saying that they who deck
themselves out in the labours of others will not allow me my own
they will say that i having no literary skill cannot properly
express that which i desire to treat of footnote 26 le mie cose
 che daltra parola this can hardly be reconciled with mons
ravaissons estimate of l da vincis learning leonard de vinci
etait un admirateur et un disciple des anciens aussi bien dans
lart que dans la science et il tenait a passer pour tel meme aux
yeux de la posterite gaz des beaux arts oct 1877 but they
do not know that my subjects are to be dealt with by experience
rather than by words footnote 28 see footnote 26 and
experience has been the mistress of those who wrote well and so
as mistress i will cite her in all cases
11
though i may not like them be able to quote other authors i shall
rely on that which is much greater and more worthyon experience
the mistress of their masters they go about puffed up and pompous
dressed and decorated with the fruits not of their own labours
but of those of others and they will not allow me my own they will
scorn me as an inventor but how much more might theywho are not
inventors but vaunters and declaimers of the works of othersbe
blamed
introduction
and those men who are inventors and interpreters between nature and
man as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of
others must be regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the
object in front of a mirror when compared with its image seen in
the mirror for the first is something in itself and the other
nothingnessfolks little indebted to nature since it is only by
chance that they wear the human form and without it i might class
them with the herds of beasts
12
many will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my
proofs are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the
highest reverence by their inexperienced judgments not considering
that my works are the issue of pure and simple experience who is
the one true mistress these rules are sufficient to enable you to
know the true from the falseand this aids men to look only for
things that are possible and with due moderationand not to wrap
yourself in ignorance a thing which can have no good result so
that in despair you would give yourself up to melancholy
13
among all the studies of natural causes and reasons light chiefly
delights the beholder and among the great features of mathematics
the certainty of its demonstrations is what preeminently tends to
elevate the mind of the investigator perspective therefore must
be preferred to all the discourses and systems of human learning in
this branch of science the beam of light is explained on those
methods of demonstration which form the glory not so much of
mathematics as of physics and are graced with the flowers of both
footnote 5 such of leonardos notes on optics or on perspective
as bear exclusively on mathematics or physics could not be included
in the arrangement of the libro di pittura which is here presented
to the reader they are however but few but its axioms being laid
down at great length i shall abridge them to a conclusive brevity
arranging them on the method both of their natural order and of
mathematical demonstration sometimes by deduction of the effects
from the causes and sometimes arguing the causes from the effects
adding also to my own conclusions some which though not included in
them may nevertheless be inferred from them thus if the lordwho
is the light of all thingsvouchsafe to enlighten me i will treat
of light wherefore i will divide the present work into 3 parts
footnote 10 in the middle agesfor instance by roger bacon by
vitellone with whose works leonardo was certainly familiar and by
all the writers of the renaissance perspective and optics were not
regarded as distinct sciences perspective indeed is in its widest
application the science of seeing although to leonardo the two
sciences were clearly separate it is not so as to their names thus
we find axioms in optics under the heading perspective according to
this arrangement of the materials for the theoretical portion of the
libro di pittura propositions in perspective and in optics stand
side by side or occur alternately although this particular chapter
deals only with optics it is not improbable that the words partiro
la presente opera in 3 parti may refer to the same division into
three sections which is spoken of in chapters 14 to 17
the plan of the book on painting 1417
14
on the three branches of perspective
there are three branches of perspective the first deals with the
reasons of the apparent diminution of objects as they recede from
the eye and is known as diminishing perspectivethe second
contains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye
the third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the
objects in a picture ought to be less finished in proportion as
they are remote and the names are as follows
linear perspective the perspective of colour the perspective of
disappearance
footnote 13 from the character of the handwriting i infer that
this passage was written before the year 1490
15
on painting and perspective
the divisions of perspective are 3 as used in drawing of these
the first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects the
second treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque
objects the third of the diminution and loss of colour at long
distances
footnote the division is here the same as in the previous chapter
no 14 and this is worthy of note when we connect it with the fact
that a space of about 20 years must have intervened between the
writing of the two passages
16
the discourse on painting
perspective as bearing on drawing is divided into three principal
sections of which the first treats of the diminution in the size of
bodies at different distances the second part is that which treats
of the diminution in colour in these objects the third deals with
the diminished distinctness of the forms and outlines displayed by
the objects at various distances
17
on the sections of the book on painting
the first thing in painting is that the objects it represents should
appear in relief and that the grounds surrounding them at different
distances shall appear within the vertical plane of the foreground
of the picture by means of the 3 branches of perspective which are
the diminution in the distinctness of the forms of the objects the
diminution in their magnitude and the diminution in their colour
and of these 3 classes of perspective the first results from the
structure of the eye while the other two are caused by the
atmosphere which intervenes between the eye and the objects seen by
it the second essential in painting is appropriate action and a due
variety in the figures so that the men may not all look like
brothers c
footnote this and the two foregoing chapters must have been
written in 1513 to 1516 they undoubtedly indicate the scheme which
leonardo wished to carry out in arranging his researches on
perspective as applied to painting this is important because it is
an evidence against the supposition of h ludwig and others that
leonardo had collected his principles of perspective in one book so
early as before 1500 a book which according to the hypothesis
must have been lost at a very early period or destroyed possibly
by the french  in 1500 see h ludwig l da vinci das buch van
der malerei vienna 1882 iii 7 and 8
the use of the book on painting
18
these rules are of use only in correcting the figures since every
man makes some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows
them not cannot amend them but you knowing your errors will
correct your works and where you find mistakes amend them and
remember never to fall into them again but if you try to apply
these rules in composition you will never make an end and will
produce confusion in your works
these rules will enable you to have a free and sound judgment since
good judgment is born of clear understanding and a clear
understanding comes of reasons derived from sound rules and sound
rules are the issue of sound experiencethe common mother of all
the sciences and arts hence bearing in mind the precepts of my
rules you will be able merely by your amended judgment to
criticise and recognise every thing that is out of proportion in a
work whether in the perspective or in the figures or any thing
else
necessity of theoretical knowledge 19 20
19
of the mistakes made by those who practise without knowledge
those who are in love with practice without knowledge are like the
sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who never
can be certain whether he is going practice must always be founded
on sound theory and to this perspective is the guide and the
gateway and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of
drawing
20
the painter who draws merely by practice and by eye without any
reason is like a mirror which copies every thing placed in front of
it without being conscious of their existence
the function of the eye 2123
21
introduction to perspectivethat is of the function of the eye
behold here o reader a thing concerning which we cannot trust our
forefathers the ancients who tried to define what the soul and
life arewhich are beyond proof whereas those things which can at
any time be clearly known and proved by experience remained for
many ages unknown or falsely understood the eye whose function we
so certainly know by experience has down to my own time been
defined by an infinite number of authors as one thing but i find
by experience that it is quite another footnote 13 compare the
note to no 70
footnote in section 13 we already find it indicated that the study
of perspective and of optics is to be based on that of the functions
of the eye leonardo also refers to the science of the eye in his
astronomical researches for instance in ms f 25b ordine del
provare la terra essere una stella imprima difinisce locchio
c compare also ms e 15b and f 60b the principles of astronomical
perspective
22
here in the eye forms here colours here the character of every
part of the universe are concentrated to a point and that point is
so marvellous a thing  oh marvellous o stupendous necessityby
thy laws thou dost compel every effect to be the direct result of
its cause by the shortest path these indeed are miracles
in so small a space it can be reproduced and rearranged in its whole
expanse describe in your anatomy what proportion there is between
the diameters of all the images in the eye and the distance from
them of the crystalline lens
23
of the 10 attributes of the eye all concerned in painting
painting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight which
aredarkness light solidity and colour form and position
distance and propinquity motion and rest this little work of mine
will be a tissue of the studies of these attributes reminding the
painter of the rules and methods by which he should use his art to
imitate all the works of nature which adorn the world
24
on painting
variability of the eye
1st the pupil of the eye contracts in proportion to the increase
of light which is reflected in it 2nd the pupil of the eye expands
in proportion to the diminution in the day light or any other
light that is reflected in it 3rd footnote 8 the subject of
this third proposition we find fully discussed in ms g 44a the
eye perceives and recognises the objects of its vision with greater
intensity in proportion as the pupil is more widely dilated and
this can be proved by the case of nocturnal animals such as cats
and certain birdsas the owl and othersin which the pupil varies
in a high degree from large to small c when in the dark or in
the light 4th the eye out of doors in an illuminated atmosphere
sees darkness behind the windows of houses which nevertheless are
light 5th all colours when placed in the shade appear of an equal
degree of darkness among themselves 6th but all colours when
placed in a full light never vary from their true and essential
hue
25
of the eye
focus of sight
if the eye is required to look at an object placed too near to it
it cannot judge of it wellas happens to a man who tries to see the
tip of his nose hence as a general rule nature teaches us that an
object can never be seen perfectly unless the space between it and
the eye is equal at least to the length of the face
differences of perception by one eye and by both eyes 2629
26
of the eye
when both eyes direct the pyramid of sight to an object that object
becomes clearly seen and comprehended by the eyes
27
objects seen by one and the same eye appear sometimes large and
sometimes small
28
the motion of a spectator who sees an object at rest often makes it
seem as though the object at rest had acquired the motion of the
moving body while the moving person appears to be at rest
on painting
objects in relief when seen from a short distance with one eye
look like a perfect picture if you look with the eye a b at
the spot c this point c will appear to be at d f and if
you look at it with the eye g h will appear to be at m a
picture can never contain in itself both aspects
29
let the object in relief t be seen by both eyes if you will look
at the object with the right eye m keeping the left eye n shut
the object will appear or fill up the space at a and if you
shut the right eye and open the left the object will occupy the
space b and if you open both eyes the object will no longer
appear at a or b but at e r f why will not a picture
seen by both eyes produce the effect of relief as real relief
does when seen by both eyes and why should a picture seen with one
eye give the same effect of relief as real relief would under the
same conditions of light and shade
footnote in the sketch m is the left eye and n the right
while the text reverses this lettering we must therefore suppose
that the face in which the eyes m and n are placed is opposite
to the spectator
30
the comparative size of the image depends on the amount of light
3039
the eye will hold and retain in itself the image of a luminous body
better than that of a shaded object the reason is that the eye is
in itself perfectly dark and since two things that are alike cannot
be distinguished therefore the night and other dark objects cannot
be seen or recognised by the eye light is totally contrary and
gives more distinctness and counteracts and differs from the usual
darkness of the eye hence it leaves the impression of its image
31
every object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday
and larger in the morning than at midday
this happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday
than at any other time
32
the pupil which is largest will see objects the largest this is
evident when we look at luminous bodies and particularly at those
in the sky when the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up
at these bodies they at first appear larger and then diminish and
if you were to look at those bodies through a small opening you
would see them smaller still because a smaller part of the pupil
would exercise its function
footnote 9 buso in the lomb dialect is the same as buco
33
when the eye coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body
it will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at
it the illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant when
seen with two eyes than with only one a luminous object will appear
smaller in size when the eye sees it through a smaller opening a
luminous body of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as
it is farther from the eye
34
why when the eye has just seen the light does the half light look
dark to it and in the same way if it turns from the darkness the
half light look very bright
35
on painting
if the eye when out of doors in the luminous atmosphere sees a
place in shadow this will look very much darker than it really is
this happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the
pupil in proportion as the atmosphere reflected in it is more
luminous and the more the pupil contracts the less luminous do the
objects appear that it sees but as soon as the eye enters into a
shady place the darkness of the shadow suddenly seems to diminish
this occurs because the greater the darkness into which the pupil
goes the more its size increases and this increase makes the
darkness seem less
footnote 14 la luce entrera luce occurs here in the sense of
pupil of the eye as in no 51 c a 84b 245a i5 and in many
other places
36
on perspective
the eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and
goes into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark
and this happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have
rested on this brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so
much that given at first a certain extent of surface they will
have lost more than 34 of their size and lacking in size they
are also deficient in seeing power though you might say to me a
little bird then coming down would see comparatively little and
from the smallness of his pupils the white might seem black to this
i should reply that here we must have regard to the proportion of
the mass of that portion of the brain which is given up to the sense
of sight and to nothing else orto returnthis pupil in man
dilates and contracts according to the brightness or darkness of
surrounding objects and since it takes some time to dilate and
contract it cannot see immediately on going out of the light and
into the shade nor in the same way out of the shade into the
light and this very thing has already deceived me in painting an
eye and from that i learnt it
37
experiment showing the dilatation and contraction of the pupil
from the motion of the sun and other luminaries in proportion as
the sky is darker the stars appear of larger size and if you were
to light up the medium these stars would look smaller and this
difference arises solely from the pupil which dilates and contracts
with the amount of light in the medium which is interposed between
the eye and the luminous body let the experiment be made by
placing a candle above your head at the same time that you look at a
star then gradually lower the candle till it is on a level with the
ray that comes from the star to the eye and then you will see the
star diminish so much that you will almost lose sight of it
footnote no reference is made in the text to the letters on the
accompanying diagram
38
the pupil of the eye in the open air changes in size with every
degree of motion from the sun and at every degree of its changes
one and the same object seen by it will appear of a different size
although most frequently the relative scale of surrounding objects
does not allow us to detect these variations in any single object we
may look at
39
the eyewhich sees all objects reversedretains the images for
some time this conclusion is proved by the results because the
eye having gazed at light retains some impression of it after
looking at it there remain in the eye images of intense
brightness that make any less brilliant spot seem dark until the
eye has lost the last trace of the impression of the stronger light
ii
linear perspective
we see clearly from the concluding sentence of section 49 where the
author directly addresses the painter that he must certainly have
intended to include the elements of mathematics in his book on the
art of painting they are therefore here placed at the beginning in
section 50 the theory of the pyramid of sight is distinctly and
expressly put forward as the fundamental principle of linear
perspective and sections 52 to 57 treat of it fully this theory of
sight can scarcely be traced to any author of antiquity such
passages as occur in euclid for instance may it is true have
proved suggestive to the painters of the renaissance but it would
be rash to say any thing decisive on this point
leon battista alberti treats of the pyramid of sight at some
length in his first book of painting but his explanation differs
widely from leonardos in the details leonardo like alberti may
have borrowed the broad lines of his theory from some views commonly
accepted among painters at the time but he certainly worked out its
application in a perfectly original manner
the axioms as to the perception of the pyramid of rays are followed
by explanations of its origin and proofs of its universal
application 5869 the author recurs to the subject with endless
variations it is evidently of fundamental importance in his
artistic theory and practice it is unnecessary to discuss how far
this theory has any scientific value at the present day so much as
this at any rate seems certain that from the artists point of
view it may still claim to be of immense practical utility
according to leonardo on one hand the laws of perspective are an
inalienable condition of the existence of objects in space on the
other hand by a natural law the eye whatever it sees and wherever
it turns is subjected to the perception of the pyramid of rays in
the form of a minute target thus it sees objects in perspective
independently of the will of the spectator since the eye receives
the images by means of the pyramid of rays just as a magnet
attracts iron
in connection with this we have the function of the eye explained by
the camera obscura and this is all the more interesting and
important because no writer previous to leonardo had treated of this
subject 7073 subsequent passages of no less special interest
betray his knowledge of refraction and of the inversion of the image
in the camera and in the eye 7482
from the principle of the transmission of the image to the eye and
to the camera obscura he deduces the means of producing an
artificial construction of the pyramid of rays orwhich is the same
thingof the image the fundamental axioms as to the angle of sight
and the vanishing point are thus presented in a manner which is as
complete as it is simple and intelligible 8689
leonardo distinguishes between simple and complex perspective 90
91 the last sections treat of the apparent size of objects at
various distances and of the way to estimate it 92109
general remarks on perspective 4041
40
on painting
perspective is the best guide to the art of painting
footnote 40 compare 53 2
41
the art of perspective is of such a nature as to make what is flat
appear in relief and what is in relief flat
the elements of perspectiveof the point 4246
42
all the problems of perspective are made clear by the five terms of
mathematicians which arethe point the line the angle the
superficies and the solid the point is unique of its kind and the
point has neither height breadth length nor depth whence it is
to be regarded as indivisible and as having no dimensions in space
the line is of three kinds straight curved and sinuous and it has
neither breadth height nor depth hence it is indivisible
excepting in its length and its ends are two points the angle is
the junction of two lines in a point
43
a point is not part of a line
44
of the natural point
the smallest natural point is larger than all mathematical points
and this is proved because the natural point has continuity and any
thing that is continuous is infinitely divisible but the
mathematical point is indivisible because it has no size
footnote this definition was inserted by leonardo on a ms copy on
parchment of the wellknown trattato darchitettura civile e
militare c by francesco di giorgio opposite a passage where the
author says in prima he da sapere che punto e quella parie della
quale he nullalinia he luncheza senza apieza c
45
1 the superficies is a limitation of the body 2 and the
limitation of a body is no part of that body 4 and the limitation
of one body is that which begins another 3 that which is not part
of any body is nothing nothing is that which fills no space
if one single point placed in a circle may be the starting point of
an infinite number of lines and the termination of an infinite
number of lines there must be an infinite number of points
separable from this point and these when reunited become one again
whence it follows that the part may be equal to the whole
46
the point being indivisible occupies no space that which occupies
no space is nothing the limiting surface of one thing is the
beginning of another 2 that which is no part of any body is called
nothing 1 that which has no limitations has no form the
limitations of two conterminous bodies are interchangeably the
surface of each all the surfaces of a body are not parts of that
body
of the line 4748
47
definition of the nature of the line
the line has in itself neither matter nor substance and may rather
be called an imaginary idea than a real object and this being its
nature it occupies no space therefore an infinite number of lines
may be conceived of as intersecting each other at a point which has
no dimensions and is only of the thickness if thickness it may be
called of one single line
how we may conclude that a superficies terminates in a point
an angular surface is reduced to a point where it terminates in an
angle or if the sides of that angle are produced in a straight
line thenbeyond that angleanother surface is generated
smaller or equal to or larger than the first
48
of drawing outline
consider with the greatest care the form of the outlines of every
object and the character of their undulations and these
undulations must be separately studied as to whether the curves are
composed of arched convexities or angular concavities
49
the nature of the outline
the boundaries of bodies are the least of all things the
proposition is proved to be true because the boundary of a thing is
a surface which is not part of the body contained within that
surface nor is it part of the air surrounding that body but is the
medium interposted between the air and the body as is proved in its
place but the lateral boundaries of these bodies is the line
forming the boundary of the surface which line is of invisible
thickness wherefore o painter do not surround your bodies with
lines and above all when representing objects smaller than nature
for not only will their external outlines become indistinct but
their parts will be invisible from distance
50
definition of perspective
drawing is based upon perspective which is nothing else than a
thorough knowledge of the function of the eye and this function
simply consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of
all the objects placed before it i say in a pyramid because there
is no object so small that it will not be larger than the spot where
these pyramids are received into the eye therefore if you extend
the lines from the edges of each body as they converge you will
bring them to a single point and necessarily the said lines must
form a pyramid
perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied
to the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit
their image to it by means of a pyramid of lines the pyramid is
the name i apply to the lines which starting from the surface and
edges of each object converge from a distance and meet in a single
point
perspective is a rational demonstration by which we may
practically and clearly understand how objects transmit their own
image by lines forming a pyramid centred in the eye
perspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms
that every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines
and bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or
smaller size according to the difference in their distance one
from the other by a pyramid of lines i mean those which start from
the surface and edges of bodies and converging from a distance
meet in a single point a point is said to be that which having no
dimensions cannot be divided and this point placed in the eye
receives all the points of the cone
footnote 50 15 compare with this the proem no 21 the
paragraphs placed in brackets lines 19 1014 and 1720 are
evidently mere sketches and as such were cancelled by the writer
but they serve as a commentary on the final paragraph lines 2229
51
in what way the eye sees objects placed in front of it
the perception of the object depends on the direction of the eye
supposing that the ball figured above is the ball of the eye and let
the small portion of the ball which is cut off by the line s t be
the pupil and all the objects mirrored on the centre of the face of
the eye by means of the pupil pass on at once and enter the pupil
passing through the crystalline humour which does not interfere in
the pupil with the things seen by means of the light and the pupil
having received the objects by means of the light immediately
refers them and transmits them to the intellect by the line a b
and you must know that the pupil transmits nothing perfectly to the
intellect or common sense excepting when the objects presented to it
by means of light reach it by the line a b as for instance by
the line b c for although the lines m n and f g may be seen
by the pupil they are not perfectly taken in because they do not
coincide with the line a b and the proof is this if the eye
shown above wants to count the letters placed in front the eye
will be obliged to turn from letter to letter because it cannot
discern them unless they lie in the line a b as for instance in
the line a c all visible objects reach the eye by the lines of a
pyramid and the point of the pyramid is the apex and centre of it
in the centre of the pupil as figured above
footnote 51 in this problem the eye is conceived of as fixed and
immovable this is plain from line 11
experimental proof of the existence of the pyramid of sight 5255
52
perspective is a rational demonstration confirmed by experience
that all objects transmit their image to the eye by a pyramid of
lines
by a pyramid of lines i understand those lines which start from the
edges of the surface of bodies and converging from a distance meet
in a single point and this point in the present instance i will
show to be situated in the eye which is the universal judge of all
objects by a point i mean that which cannot be divided into parts
therefore this point which is situated in the eye being
indivisible no body is seen by the eye that is not larger than
this point this being the case it is inevitable that the lines
which come from the object to the point must form a pyramid and if
any man seeks to prove that the sense of sight does not reside in
this point but rather in the black spot which is visible in the
middle of the pupil i might reply to him that a small object could
never diminish at any distance as it might be a grain of millet or
of oats or of some similar thing and that object if it were larger
than the said black spot would never be seen as a whole as may be
seen in the diagram below let a be the seat of sight b e the
lines which reach the eye let e d be the grains of millet within
these lines you plainly see that these will never diminish by
distance and that the body m n could not be entirely covered by
it therefore you must confess that the eye contains within itself
one single indivisible point a to which all the points converge
of the pyramid of lines starting from an object as is shown below
let a b be the eye in the centre of it is the point above
mentioned if the line e f is to enter as an image into so small
an opening in the eye you must confess that the smaller object
cannot enter into what is smaller than itself unless it is
diminished and by diminishing it must take the form of a pyramid
53
perspective
perspective comes in where judgment fails as to the distance in
objects which diminish the eye can never be a true judge for
determining with exactitude how near one object is to another which
is equal to it in size if the top of that other is on the level
of the eye which sees them on that side excepting by means of the
vertical plane which is the standard and guide of perspective let
n be the eye e f the vertical plane above mentioned let a b c
d be the three divisions one below the other if the lines a n
and c n are of a given length and the eye n is in the centre
then a b will look as large as b c c d is lower and farther off
from n therefore it will look smaller and the same effect will
appear in the three divisions of a face when the eye of the painter
who is drawing it is on a level with the eye of the person he is
painting
54
to prove how objects reach the eye
if you look at the sun or some other luminous body and then shut
your eyes you will see it again inside your eye for a long time
this is evidence that images enter into the eye
the relations of the distance points to the vanishing point 5556
55
elements of perspective
all objects transmit their image to the eye in pyramids and the
nearer to the eye these pyramids are intersected the smaller will
the image appear of the objects which cause them therefore you may
intersect the pyramid with a vertical plane footnote 4 pariete
compare the definitions in 85 25 627 these lines refer
exclusively to the third diagram for the better understanding of
this it should be observed that c s must be regarded as
representing the section or profile of a square plane placed
horizontally comp lines 11 14 17 for which the word pianura
is subsequently employed 20 22 lines 613 contain certain
preliminary observations to guide the reader in understanding the
diagram the last three seem to have been added as a supplement
leonardos mistake in writing t denota line 6 for f denota has
been rectified which reaches the base of the pyramid as is shown
in the plane a n
the eye f and the eye t are one and the same thing but the eye
f marks the distance that is to say how far you are standing from
the object and the eye t shows you the direction of it that is
whether you are opposite or on one side or at an angle to the
object you are looking at and remember that the eye f and the eye
t must always be kept on the same level for example if you raise
or lower the eye from the distance point f you must do the same
with the direction point t and if the point f shows how far the
eye is distant from the square plane but does not show on which side
it is placedand if in the same way the point t show s the
direction and not the distance in order to ascertain both you must
use both points and they will be one and the same thing if the eye
f could see a perfect square of which all the sides were equal to
the distance between s and c and if at the nearest end of the
side towards the eye a pole were placed or some other straight
object set up by a perpendicular line as shown at r sthen i
say that if you were to look at the side of the square that is
nearest to you it will appear at the bottom of the vertical plane r
s and then look at the farther side and it would appear to you at
the height of the point n on the vertical plane thus by this
example you can understand that if the eye is above a number of
objects all placed on the same level one beyond another the more
remote they are the higher they will seem up to the level of the
eye but no higher because objects placed upon the level on which
your feet stand so long as it is flateven if it be extended into
infinitywould never be seen above the eye since the eye has in
itself the point towards which all the cones tend and converge which
convey the images of the objects to the eye and this point always
coincides with the point of diminution which is the extreme of all
we can see and from the base line of the first pyramid as far as
the diminishing point
footnote the two diagrams above the chapter are explained by the
first five lines they have however more letters than are referred
to in the text a circumstance we frequently find occasion to
remark
56
there are only bases without pyramids which constantly diminish up
to this point and from the first base where the vertical plane is
placed towards the point in the eye there will be only pyramids
without bases as shown in the example given above now let a b
be the said vertical plane and r the point of the pyramid
terminating in the eye and n the point of diminution which is
always in a straight line opposite the eye and always moves as the
eye movesjust as when a rod is moved its shadow moves and moves
with it precisely as the shadow moves with a body and each point
is the apex of a pyramid all having a common base with the
intervening vertical plane but although their bases are equal their
angles are not equal because the diminishing point is the
termination of a smaller angle than that of the eye if you ask me
by what practical experience can you show me these points i
replyso far as concerns the diminishing point which moves with you
when you walk by a ploughed field look at the straight furrows
which come down with their ends to the path where you are walking
and you will see that each pair of furrows will look as though they
tried to get nearer and meet at the farther end
footnote for the easier understanding of the diagram and of its
connection with the preceding i may here remark that the square
plane shown above in profile by the line c s is here indicated by
e d o p according to lines 1 3 a b must be imagined as a plane
of glass placed perpendicularly at o p
57
how to measure the pyramid of vision
as regards the point in the eye it is made more intelligible by
this if you look into the eye of another person you will see your
own image now imagine 2 lines starting from your ears and going to
the ears of that image which you see in the other mans eye you
will understand that these lines converge in such a way that they
would meet in a point a little way beyond your own image mirrored in
the eye and if you want to measure the diminution of the pyramid in
the air which occupies the space between the object seen and the
eye you must do it according to the diagram figured below let m
n be a tower and e f a rod which you must move backwards and
forwards till its ends correspond with those of the tower footnote
9 i sua stremi  della storre its ends  of the tower this
is the case at e f then bring it nearer to the eye at c d
and you will see that the image of the tower seems smaller as at r
o then again bring it closer to the eye and you will see the rod
project far beyond the image of the tower from a to b and from
t to b and so you will discern that a little farther within
the lines must converge in a point
the production of pyramid of vision 5860

perspective
the instant the atmosphere is illuminated it will be filled with an
infinite number of images which are produced by the various bodies
and colours assembled in it and the eye is the target a loadstone
of these images
59
the whole surface of opaque bodies displays its whole image in all
the illuminated atmosphere which surrounds them on all sides
60
that the atmosphere attracts to itself like a loadstone all the
images of the objects that exist in it and not their forms merely
but their nature may be clearly seen by the sun which is a hot and
luminous body all the atmosphere which is the allpervading
matter absorbs light and heat and reflects in itself the image of
the source of that heat and splendour and in each minutest portion
does the same the northpole does the same as the loadstone shows
and the moon and the other planets without suffering any
diminution do the same among terrestrial things musk does the same
and other perfumes
61
all bodies together and each by itself give off to the surrounding
air an infinite number of images which are allpervading and each
complete each conveying the nature colour and form of the body
which produces it
it can clearly be shown that all bodies are by their images
allpervading in the surrounding atmosphere and each complete in
itself as to substance form and colour this is seen by the images
of the various bodies which are reproduced in one single perforation
through which they transmit the objects by lines which intersect and
cause reversed pyramids from the objects so that they are upside
down on the dark plane where they are first reflected the reason of
this is
footnote the diagram intended to illustrate the statement pl ii
no i occurs in the original between lines 3 and 4 the three
circles must be understood to represent three luminous bodies which
transmit their images through perforations in a wall into a dark
chamber according to a law which is more fully explained in 7581
so far as concerns the present passage the diagram is only intended
to explain that the images of the three bodies may be made to
coalesce at any given spot in the circles are written

the text breaks off at line 8 the paragraph no40 follows here in
the original ms
62
every point is the termination of an infinite number of lines which
diverge to form a base and immediately from the base the same
lines converge to a pyramid imaging both the colour and form no
sooner is a form created or compounded than suddenly infinite lines
and angles are produced from it and these lines distributing
themselves and intersecting each other in the air give rise to an
infinite number of angles opposite to each other given a base each
opposite angle will form a triangle having a form and proportion
equal to the larger angle and if the base goes twice into each of
the 2 lines of the pyramid the smaller triangle will do the same
63
every body in light and shade fills the surrounding air with
infinite images of itself and these by infinite pyramids diffused
in the air represent this body throughout space and on every side
each pyramid that is composed of a long assemblage of rays includes
within itself an infinite number of pyramids and each has the same
power as all and all as each a circle of equidistant pyramids of
vision will give to their object angles of equal size and an eye at
each point will see the object of the same size the body of the
atmosphere is full of infinite pyramids composed of radiating
straight lines which are produced from the surface of the bodies in
light and shade existing in the air and the farther they are from
the object which produces them the more acute they become and
although in their distribution they intersect and cross they never
mingle together but pass through all the surrounding air
independently converging spreading and diffused and they are all
of equal power and value all equal to each and each equal to
all by these the images of objects are transmitted through all
space and in every direction and each pyramid in itself includes
in each minutest part the whole form of the body causing it
64
the body of the atmosphere is full of infinite radiating pyramids
produced by the objects existing in it these intersect and cross
each other with independent convergence without interfering with
each other and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere and are
of equal force and valueall being equal to each each to all and
by means of these images of the body are transmitted everywhere and
on all sides and each receives in itself every minutest portion of
the object that produces it
proof by experiment 6566
65
perspective
the air is filled with endless images of the objects distributed in
it and all are represented in all and all in one and all in each
whence it happens that if two mirrors are placed in such a manner as
to face each other exactly the first will be reflected in the
second and the second in the first the first being reflected in the
second takes to it the image of itself with all the images
represented in it among which is the image of the second mirror
and so image within image they go on to infinity in such a manner
as that each mirror has within it a mirror each smaller than the
last and one inside the other thus by this example it is clearly
proved that every object sends its image to every spot whence the
object itself can be seen and the converse that the same object
may receive in itself all the images of the objects that are in
front of it hence the eye transmits through the atmosphere its own
image to all the objects that are in front of it and receives them
into itself that is to say on its surface whence they are taken in
by the common sense which considers them and if they are pleasing
commits them to the memory whence i am of opinion that the
invisible images in the eyes are produced towards the object as the
image of the object to the eye that the images of the objects must
be disseminated through the air an instance may be seen in several
mirrors placed in a circle which will reflect each other endlessly
when one has reached the other it is returned to the object that
produced it and thencebeing diminishedit is returned again to
the object and then comes back once more and this happens
endlessly if you put a light between two flat mirrors with a
distance of 1 braccio between them you will see in each of them an
infinite number of lights one smaller than another to the last if
at night you put a light between the walls of a room all the parts
of that wall will be tinted with the image of that light and they
will receive the light and the light will fall on them mutually
that is to say when there is no obstacle to interrupt the
transmission of the images this same example is seen in a greater
degree in the distribution of the solar rays which all together and
each by itself convey to the object the image of the body which
causes it that each body by itself alone fills with its images the
atmosphere around it and that the same air is able at the same
time to receive the images of the endless other objects which are
in it this is clearly proved by these examples and every object is
everywhere visible in the whole of the atmosphere and the whole in
every smallest part of it and all the objects in the whole and all
in each smallest part each in all and all in every part
66
the images of objects are all diffused through the atmosphere which
receives them and all on every side in it to prove this let a c
e be objects of which the images are admitted to a dark chamber by
the small holes n p and thrown upon the plane f i opposite to
these holes as many images will be produced in the chamber on the
plane as the number of the said holes
67
general conclusions
all objects project their whole image and likeness diffused and
mingled in the whole of the atmosphere opposite to themselves the
image of every point of the bodily surface exists in every part of
the atmosphere all the images of the objects are in every part of
the atmosphere the whole and each part of the image of the
atmosphere is reflected in each point of the surface of the bodies
presented to it therefore both the part and the whole of the images
of the objects exist both in the whole and in the parts of the
surface of these visible bodies whence we may evidently say that
the image of each object exists as a whole and in every part in
each part and in the whole interchangeably in every existing body
as is seen in two mirrors placed opposite to each other
68
that the contrary is impossible
it is impossible that the eye should project from itself by visual
rays the visual virtue since as soon as it opens that front
portion of the eye which would give rise to this emanation would
have to go forth to the object and this it could not do without
time and this being so it could not travel so high as the sun in a
months time when the eye wanted to see it and if it could reach
the sun it would necessarily follow that it should perpetually
remain in a continuous line from the eye to the sun and should
always diverge in such a way as to form between the sun and the eye
the base and the apex of a pyramid this being the case if the eye
consisted of a million worlds it would not prevent its being
consumed in the projection of its virtue and if this virtue would
have to travel through the air as perfumes do the winds would bent
it and carry it into another place but we do in fact see the mass
of the sun with the same rapidity as an object at the distance of
a braccio and the power of sight is not disturbed by the blowing of
the winds nor by any other accident
footnote the view here refuted by leonardo was maintained among
others by bramantino leonardos milanese contemporary lomazzo
writes as follows in his trattato dell arte della pittura c
milano 1584 libr v cp xxi sovviemmi di aver gia letto in certi
scritti alcune cose di bramantino milanese celebratissimo pittore
attenente alla prospettiva le quali ho voluto riferire e quasi
intessere in questo luogo affinche sappiamo qual fosse lopinione
di cosi chiaro e famoso pittore intorno alla prospettiva   scrive
bramantino che la prospettiva e una cosa che contrafa il naturale e
che cio si fa in tre modi
circa il primo modo che si fa con ragione per essere la cosa in
poche parole conclusa da bramantino in maniera che giudico non
potersi dir meglio contenendovi si tutta parte del principio al
fine io riferiro per appunto le proprie parole sue cp xxii prima
prospettiva di bramantino la prima prospettiva fa le cose di
punto e laltra non mai e la terza piu appresso adunque la prima
si dimanda prospettiva cioe ragione la quale fa leffetto dell
occhio facendo crescere e calare secondo gli effetti degli occhi
questo crescere e calare non procede della cosa propria che in se
per esser lontana ovvero vicina per quello effetto non puo
crescere e sminuire ma procede dagli effetti degli occhi i quali
sono piccioli e percio volendo vedere tanto gran cosa bisogna che
mandino fuora la virtu visiva la quale si dilata in tanta
larghezza che piglia tutto quello che vuoi vedere ed arrivando a
quella cosa la vede dove e e da lei agli occhi per quello circuito
fino all occhio e tutto quello termine e pieno di quella cosa
it is worthy of note that leonardo had made his memorandum refuting
this view at milan in 1492

a parallel case
just as a stone flung into the water becomes the centre and cause of
many circles and as sound diffuses itself in circles in the air so
any object placed in the luminous atmosphere diffuses itself in
circles and fills the surrounding air with infinite images of
itself and is repeated the whole everywhere and the whole in
every smallest part this can be proved by experiment since if you
shut a window that faces west and make a hole footnote 6 here the

the function of the eye as explained by the camera obscura 70 71
70
if the object in front of the eye sends its image to the eye the
eye on the other hand sends its image to the object and no
portion whatever of the object is lost in the images it throws off
for any reason either in the eye or the object therefore we may
rather believe it to be the nature and potency of our luminous
atmosphere which absorbs the images of the objects existing in it
than the nature of the objects to send their images through the
air if the object opposite to the eye were to send its image to the
eye the eye would have to do the same to the object whence it
might seem that these images were an emanation but if so it would
be necessary to admit that every object became rapidly smaller
because each object appears by its images in the surrounding
atmosphere that is the whole object in the whole atmosphere and
in each part and all the objects in the whole atmosphere and all of
them in each part speaking of that atmosphere which is able to
contain in itself the straight and radiating lines of the images
projected by the objects from this it seems necessary to admit that
it is in the nature of the atmosphere which subsists between the
objects and which attracts the images of things to itself like a
loadstone being placed between them
prove how all objects placed in one position are all everywhere
and all in each part
i say that if the front of a buildingor any open piazza or
fieldwhich is illuminated by the sun has a dwelling opposite to
it and if in the front which does not face the sun you make a
small round hole all the illuminated objects will project their
images through that hole and be visible inside the dwelling on the
opposite wall which may be made white and there in fact they will
be upside down and if you make similar openings in several places
in the same wall you will have the same result from each hence the
images of the illuminated objects are all everywhere on this wall
and all in each minutest part of it the reason as we clearly know
is that this hole must admit some light to the said dwelling and
the light admitted by it is derived from one or many luminous
bodies if these bodies are of various colours and shapes the rays
forming the images are of various colours and shapes and so will
the representations be on the wall
footnote 70 1523 this section has already been published in the
saggio delle opere di leonardo da vinci milan 1872 pp 13 14
g govi observes upon it that leonardo is not to be regarded as the
inventor of the camera obscura but that he was the first to explain
by it the structure of the eye an account of the camera obscura
first occurs in cesare cesarinis italian version of vitruvius pub
1523 four years after leonardos death cesarini expressly names
benedettino don papnutio as the inventor of the camera obscura in
his explanation of the function of the eye by a comparison with the
camera obscura leonardo was the precursor of g cardano professor
of medicine at bologna died 1576 and it appears highly probable
that this is in fact the very discovery which leonardo ascribes to
himself in section 21 without giving any further details
71
how the images of objects received by the eye intersect within the
crystalline humour of the eye
an experiment showing how objects transmit their images or
pictures intersecting within the eye in the crystalline humour is
seen when by some small round hole penetrate the images of
illuminated objects into a very dark chamber then receive these
images on a white paper placed within this dark room and rather near
to the hole and you will see all the objects on the paper in their
proper forms and colours but much smaller and they will be upside
down by reason of that very intersection these images being
transmitted from a place illuminated by the sun will seem actually
painted on this paper which must be extremely thin and looked at
from behind and let the little perforation be made in a very thin
plate of iron let a b e d e be the object illuminated by the sun
and o r the front of the dark chamber in which is the said hole at
n m let s t be the sheet of paper intercepting the rays of the
images of these objects upside down because the rays being
straight a on the right hand becomes k on the left and e on
the left becomes f on the right and the same takes place inside
the pupil

the practice of perspective 72 73
72
in the practice of perspective the same rules apply to light and to
the eye
73
the object which is opposite to the pupil of the eye is seen by that
pupil and that which is opposite to the eye is seen by the pupil
refraction of the rays falling upon the eye 74 75
74
the lines sent forth by the image of an object to the eye do not
reach the point within the eye in straight lines
75
if the judgment of the eye is situated within it the straight lines
of the images are refracted on its surface because they pass through
the rarer to the denser medium if when you are under water you
look at objects in the air you will see them out of their true
place and the same with objects under water seen from the air
the intersection of the rays 7682
76
the inversion of the images
all the images of objects which pass through a window glass pane
from the free outer air to the air confined within walls are seen
on the opposite side and an object which moves in the outer air
from east to west will seem in its shadow on the wall which is
lighted by this confined air to have an opposite motion
77
the principle on which the images of bodies pass in between the
margins of the openings by which they enter
what difference is there in the way in which images pass through
narrow openings and through large openings or in those which pass
by the sides of shaded bodies by moving the edges of the opening
through which the images are admitted the images of immovable
objects are made to move and this happens as is shown in the 9th
which demonstrates footnote 11 per la 9a che dicie when
leonardo refers thus to a number it serves to indicate marginal
diagrams this can in some instances be distinctly proved the ninth
sketch on the page w l 145 b corresponds to the middle sketch of
the three reproduced the images of any object are all everywhere
and all in each part of the surrounding air it follows that if one
of the edges of the hole by which the images are admitted to a dark
chamber is moved it cuts off those rays of the image that were in
contact with it and gets nearer to other rays which previously were
remote from it c
of the movement of the edge at the right or left or the upper or
lower edge
if you move the right side of the opening the image on the left will
move being that of the object which entered on the right side of
the opening and the same result will happen with all the other
sides of the opening this can be proved by the 2nd of this which
shows all the rays which convey the images of objects through the
air are straight lines hence if the images of very large bodies
have to pass through very small holes and beyond these holes
recover their large size the lines must necessarily intersect
footnote 77 2 in the first of the three diagrams leonardo had
drawn only one of the two margins et m
78
necessity has provided that all the images of objects in front of
the eye shall intersect in two places one of these intersections is
in the pupil the other in the crystalline lens and if this were
not the case the eye could not see so great a number of objects as
it does this can be proved since all the lines which intersect do
so in a point because nothing is seen of objects excepting their
surface and their edges are lines in contradistinction to the
definition of a surface and each minute part of a line is equal to
a point for smallest is said of that than which nothing can be
smaller and this definition is equivalent to the definition of the
point hence it is possible for the whole circumference of a circle
to transmit its image to the point of intersection as is shown in
the 4th of this which shows all the smallest parts of the images
cross each other without interfering with each other these
demonstrations are to illustrate the eye no image even of the
smallest object enters the eye without being turned upside down
but as it penetrates into the crystalline lens it is once more
reversed and thus the image is restored to the same position within
the eye as that of the object outside the eye
79
of the central line of the eye
only one line of the image of all those that reach the visual
virtue has no intersection and this has no sensible dimensions
because it is a mathematical line which originates from a
mathematical point which has no dimensions
according to my adversary necessity requires that the central line
of every image that enters by small and narrow openings into a dark
chamber shall be turned upside down together with the images of the
bodies that surround it
80
as to whether the central line of the image can be intersected or
not within the opening
it is impossible that the line should intersect itself that is
that its right should cross over to its left side and so its left
side become its right side because such an intersection demands two
lines one from each side for there can be no motion from right to
left or from left to right in itself without such extension and
thickness as admit of such motion and if there is extension it is
no longer a line but a surface and we are investigating the
properties of a line and not of a surface and as the line having
no centre of thickness cannot be divided we must conclude that the
line can have no sides to intersect each other this is proved by
the movement of the line a f to a b and of the line e b to e
f which are the sides of the surface a f e b but if you move
the line a b and the line e f with the frontends a e to the
spot c you will have moved the opposite ends f b towards each
other at the point d and from the two lines you will have drawn
the straight line c d which cuts the middle of the intersection of
these two lines at the point n without any intersection for you
imagine these two lines as having breadth it is evident that by
this motion the first will entirely cover the otherbeing equal
with itwithout any intersection in the position c d and this
is sufficient to prove our proposition
81
how the innumerable rays from innumerable images can converge to a
point
just as all lines can meet at a point without interfering with each
otherbeing without breadth or thicknessin the same way all the
images of surfaces can meet there and as each given point faces the
object opposite to it and each object faces an opposite point the
converging rays of the image can pass through the point and diverge
again beyond it to reproduce and remagnify the real size of that
image but their impressions will appear reversedas is shown in
the first above where it is said that every image intersects as it
enters the narrow openings made in a very thin substance
read the marginal text on the other side
in proportion as the opening is smaller than the shaded body so
much less will the images transmitted through this opening intersect
each other the sides of images which pass through openings into a
dark room intersect at a point which is nearer to the opening in
proportion as the opening is narrower to prove this let a b be an
object in light and shade which sends not its shadow but the image
of its darkened form through the opening d e which is as wide as
this shaded body and its sides a b being straight lines as has
been proved must intersect between the shaded object and the
opening but nearer to the opening in proportion as it is smaller
than the object in shade as is shown on your right hand and your
left hand in the two diagrams a b c n m o where the
right opening d e being equal in width to the shaded object a
b the intersection of the sides of the said shaded object occurs
half way between the opening and the shaded object at the point c
but this cannot happen in the left hand figure the opening o
being much smaller than the shaded object n m
it is impossible that the images of objects should be seen between
the objects and the openings through which the images of these
bodies are admitted and this is plain because where the atmosphere
is illuminated these images are not formed visibly
when the images are made double by mutually crossing each other they
are invariably doubly as dark in tone to prove this let d e h
be such a doubling which although it is only seen within the space
between the bodies in b and i this will not hinder its being
seen from f g or from f m being composed of the images a
b i k which run together in d e h

an experiment showing that though the pupil may not be moved from
its position the objects seen by it may appear to move from their
places
if you look at an object at some distance from you and which is
below the eye and fix both your eyes upon it and with one hand
firmly hold the upper lid open while with the other you push up the
under lidstill keeping your eyes fixed on the object gazed atyou
will see that object double one image remaining steady and the
other moving in a contrary direction to the pressure of your finger

this happens because the pupil of the eye is displaced from its
position

demostration of perspective by means of a vertical glass plane
8385
83
of the plane of glass
perspective is nothing else than seeing place or objects behind a
plane of glass quite transparent on the surface of which the
objects behind that glass are to be drawn these can be traced in
pyramids to the point in the eye and these pyramids are intersected
on the glass plane
84
pictorial perspective can never make an object at the same distance
look of the same size as it appears to the eye you see that the
apex of the pyramid f c d is as far from the object c d as the
same point f is from the object a b and yet c d which is
the base made by the painters point is smaller than a b which
is the base of the lines from the objects converging in the eye and
refracted at s t the surface of the eye this may be proved by
experiment by the lines of vision and then by the lines of the
painters plumbline by cutting the real lines of vision on one and
the same plane and measuring on it one and the same object
85
perspective
the vertical plane is a perpendicular line imagined as in front of
the central point where the apex of the pyramids converge and this
plane bears the same relation to this point as a plane of glass
would through which you might see the various objects and draw them
on it and the objects thus drawn would be smaller than the
originals in proportion as the distance between the glass and the
eye was smaller than that between the glass and the objects
perspective
the different converging pyramids produced by the objects will
show on the plane the various sizes and remoteness of the objects
causing them
perspective
all those horizontal planes of which the extremes are met by
perpendicular lines forming right angles if they are of equal width
the more they rise to the level of eye the less this is seen and
the more the eye is above them the more will their real width be
seen
perspective
the farther a spherical body is from the eye the more you will see
of it
the angle of sight varies with the distance 8688

a simple and natural method showing how objects appear to the eye
without any other medium
the object that is nearest to the eye always seems larger than
another of the same size at greater distance the eye m seeing
the spaces o v x hardly detects the difference between them and
the reason of this is that it is close to them footnote 6 it is
quite inconceivable to me why m ravaisson in a note to his french
translation of this simple passage should have remarked il est
clair que cest par erreur que leonard a ecrit per esser visino au
lieu de per non esser visino see his printed ed of ms a p
38 but if these spaces are marked on the vertical plane n o
the space o v will be seen at o r and in the same way the space
v x will appear at r q and if you carry this out in any place
where you can walk round it will look out of proportion by reason
of the great difference in the spaces o r and r q and this
proceeds from the eye being so much below near the plane that the
plane is foreshortened hence if you wanted to carry it out you
would have to arrange to see the perspective through a single hole
which must be at the point m or else you must go to a distance of
at least 3 times the height of the object you see the plane o p
being always equally remote from the eye will reproduce the objects
in a satisfactory way so that they may be seen from place to place
87
how every large mass sends forth its images which may diminish
through infinity
the images of any large mass being infinitely divisible may be
infinitely diminished
88
objects of equal size situated in various places will be seen by
different pyramids which will each be smaller in proportion as the
object is farther off
89
perspective in dealing with distances makes use of two opposite
pyramids one of which has its apex in the eye and the base as
distant as the horizon the other has the base towards the eye and
the apex on the horizon now the first includes the visible
universe embracing all the mass of the objects that lie in front of
the eye as it might be a vast landscape seen through a very small
opening for the more remote the objects are from the eye the
greater number can be seen through the opening and thus the pyramid
is constructed with the base on the horizon and the apex in the eye
as has been said the second pyramid is extended to a spot which is
smaller in proportion as it is farther from the eye and this second
perspective  pyramid results from the first
90
simple perspective
simple perspective is that which is constructed by art on a vertical
plane which is equally distant from the eye in every part complex
perspective is that which is constructed on a groundplan in which
none of the parts are equally distant from the eye
91
perspective
no surface can be seen exactly as it is if the eye that sees it is
not equally remote from all its edges
92
why when an object is placed close to the eye its edges are
indistinct
when an object opposite the eye is brought too close to it its
edges must become too confused to be distinguished as it happens
with objects close to a light which cast a large and indistinct
shadow so is it with an eye which estimates objects opposite to it
in all cases of linear perspective the eye acts in the same way as
the light and the reason is that the eye has one leading line of
vision which dilates with distance and embraces with true
discernment large objects at a distance as well as small ones that
are close but since the eye sends out a multitude of lines which
surround this chief central one and since these which are farthest
from the centre in this cone of lines are less able to discern with
accuracy it follows that an object brought close to the eye is not
at a due distance but is too near for the central line to be able
to discern the outlines of the object so the edges fall within the
lines of weaker discerning power and these are to the function of
the eye like dogs in the chase which can put up the game but cannot
take it thus these cannot take in the objects but induce the
central line of sight to turn upon them when they have put them up
hence the objects which are seen with these lines of sight have
confused outlines
the relative size of objects with regard to their distance from the
eye 9398
93
perspective
small objects close at hand and large ones at a distance being seen
within equal angles will appear of the same size
94
perspective
there is no object so large but that at a great distance from the
eye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near
95
among objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye
will look the smallest footnote this axiom sufficiently clear in
itself is in the original illustrated by a very large diagram
constructed like that here reproduced under no 108
the same idea is repeated in c a i a i a stated as follows
infra le cose dequal grandeza quella si dimostra di minor figura
che sara piu distante dall ochio
96
why an object is less distinct when brought near to the eye and why
with spectacles or without the naked eye sees badly either close or
far off as the case may be
97
perspective
among objects of equal size that which is most remote from the eye
will look the smallest
98
perspective
no second object can be so much lower than the first as that the eye
will not see it higher than the first if the eye is above the
second
perspective
and this second object will never be so much higher than the first
as that the eye being below them will not see the second as lower
than the first
perspective
if the eye sees a second square through the centre of a smaller one
that is nearer the second larger square will appear to be
surrounded by the smaller one
perspectiveproposition
objects that are farther off can never be so large but that those in
front though smaller will conceal or surround them
definition
this proposition can be proved by experiment for if you look
through a small hole there is nothing so large that it cannot be
seen through it and the object so seen appears surrounded and
enclosed by the outline of the sides of the hole and if you stop it
up this small stopping will conceal the view of the largest object
the apparent size of objects defined by calculation 99105
99
of linear perspective
linear perspective deals with the action of the lines of sight in
proving by measurement how much smaller is a second object than the
first and how much the third is smaller than the second and so on
by degrees to the end of things visible i find by experience that
if a second object is as far beyond the first as the first is from
the eye although they are of the same size the second will seem
half the size of the first and if the third object is of the same
size as the 2nd and the 3rd is as far beyond the second as the 2nd
from the first it will appear of half the size of the second and
so on by degrees at equal distances the next farthest will be half
the size of the former object so long as the space does not exceed
the length of 20 braccia but beyond 20 braccia figures of equal
size will lose 24 and at 40 braccia they will lose 910 and 1920
at 60 braccia and so on diminishing by degrees this is if the
picture plane is distant from you twice your own height if it is
only as far off as your own height there will be a great difference
between the first braccia and the second
footnote this chapter is included in dufresnes and manzis
editions of the treatise on painting h ludwig in his commentary
calls this chapter eines der wichtigsten im ganzen tractat but
at the same time he asserts that its substance has been so
completely disfigured in the best ms copies that we ought not to
regard leonardo as responsible for it however in the case of this
chapter the old ms copies agree with the original as it is
reproduced above from the chapters given later in this edition
which were written at a subsequent date it would appear that
leonardo corrected himself on these points
100
of the diminution of objects at various distances
a second object as far distant from the first as the first is from
the eye will appear half the size of the first though they be of
the same size really
of the degrees of diminution
if you place the vertical plane at one braccio from the eye the
first object being at a distance of 4 braccia from your eye will
diminish to 34 of its height at that plane and if it is 8 braccia
from the eye to 78 and if it is 16 braccia off it will diminish
to 1516 of its height and so on by degrees as the space doubles
the diminution will double
101
begin from the line m f with the eye below then go up and do the
same with the line n f then with the eye above and close to the 2
gauges on the ground look at m n then as c m is to m n so
will n m be to n s
if a n goes 3 times into f b m p will do the same into p g
then go backwards so far as that c d goes twice into a n and p
g will be equal to g h and m p will go into h p as often as
d c into o p
footnote the first three lines are unfortunately very obscure
102
i give the degrees of the objects seen by the eye as the musician
does the notes heard by the ear
although the objects seen by the eye do in fact touch each other
as they recede i will nevertheless found my rule on spaces of 20
braccia each as a musician does with notes which though they can
be carried on one into the next he divides into degrees from note
to note calling them 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th and has affixed a name
to each degree in raising or lowering the voice
103
perspective
let f be the level and distance of the eye and a the vertical
plane as high as a man let e be a man then i say that on the
plane this will be the distance from the plane to the 2nd man
104
the differences in the diminution of objects of equal size in
consequence of their various remoteness from the eye will bear among
themselves the same proportions as those of the spaces between the
eye and the different objects
find out how much a man diminishes at a certain distance and what
its length is and then at twice that distance and at 3 times and
so make your general rule
105
the eye cannot judge where an object high up ought to descend
106
perspective
if two similar and equal objects are placed one beyond the other at
a given distance the difference in their size will appear greater in
proportion as they are nearer to the eye that sees them and
conversely there will seem to be less difference in their size in
proportion as they are remote from the eve
this is proved by the proportions of their distances among
themselves for if the first of these two objects were as far from
the eye as the 2nd from the first this would be called the second
proportion since if the first is at 1 braccia from the eye and the
2nd at two braccia two being twice as much as one the first object
will look twice as large as the second but if you place the first
at a hundred braccia from you and the second at a hundred and one
you will find that the first is only so much larger than the second
as 100 is less than 101 and the converse is equally true and
again the same thing is proved by the 4th of this book which shows
that among objects that are equal there is the same proportion in
the diminution of the size as in the increase in the distance from
the eye of the spectator
on natural perspective 107109
107
of equal objects the most remote look the smallest
the practice of perspective may be divided into  parts footnote
4 in  parte the space for the number is left blank in the
original of which the first treats of objects seen by the eye at
any distance and it shows all these objects just as the eye sees
them diminished without obliging a man to stand in one place rather
than another so long as the plane does not produce a second
foreshortening
but the second practice is a combination of perspective derived
partly from art and partly from nature and the work done by its
rules is in every portion of it influenced by natural perspective
and artificial perspective by natural perspective i mean that the
plane on which this perspective is represented is a flat surface
and this plane although it is parallel both in length and height
is forced to diminish in its remoter parts more than in its nearer
ones and this is proved by the first of what has been said above
and its diminution is natural but artificial perspective that is
that which is devised by art does the contrary for objects equal
in size increase on the plane where it is foreshortened in
proportion as the eye is more natural and nearer to the plane and
as the part of the plane on which it is figured is farther from the
eye
and let this plane be d e on which are seen 3 equal circles which
are beyond this plane d e that is the circles a b c now you
see that the eye h sees on the vertical plane the sections of the
images largest of those that are farthest and smallest of the
nearest
108
here follows what is wanting in the margin at the foot on the other
side of this page
natural perspective acts in a contrary way for at greater
distances the object seen appears smaller and at a smaller distance
the object appears larger but this said invention requires the
spectator to stand with his eye at a small hole and then at that
small hole it will be very plain but since many mens eyes
endeavour at the same time to see one and the same picture produced
by this artifice only one can see clearly the effect of this
perspective and all the others will see confusion it is well
therefore to avoid such complex perspective and hold to simple
perspective which does not regard planes as foreshortened but as
much as possible in their proper form this simple perspective in
which the plane intersects the pyramids by which the images are
conveyed to the eye at an equal distance from the eye is our
constant experience from the curved form of the pupil of the eye on
which the pyramids are intersected at an equal distance from the
visual virtue
footnote 24 la prima di sopra i e the first of the three
diagrams which in the original ms are placed in the margin at the
beginning of this chapter
109
of a mixture of natural and artificial perspective
this diagram distinguishes natural from artificial perspective but
before proceeding any farther i will define what is natural and what
is artificial perspective natural perspective says that the more
remote of a series of objects of equal size will look the smaller
and conversely the nearer will look the larger and the apparent
size will diminish in proportion to the distance but in artificial
perspective when objects of unequal size are placed at various
distances the smallest is nearer to the eye than the largest and
the greatest distance looks as though it were the least of all and
the cause of this is the plane on which the objects are represented
and which is at unequal distances from the eye throughout its
length and this diminution of the plane is natural but the
perspective shown upon it is artificial since it nowhere agrees with
the true diminution of the said plane whence it follows that when
the eye is somewhat removed from the station point of the
perspective that it has been gazing at all the objects represented
look monstrous and this does not occur in natural perspective
which has been defined above let us say then that the square a b
c d figured above is foreshortened being seen by the eye situated
in the centre of the side which is in front but a mixture of
artificial and natural perspective will be seen in this tetragon
called el main footnote 20 el main is quite legibly written in
the original the meaning and derivation of the word are equally
doubtful that is to say e f g h which must appear to the eye of
the spectator to be equal to a b c d so long as the eye remains in
its first position between c and d and this will be seen to
have a good effect because the natural perspective of the plane
will conceal the defects which would otherwise seem monstrous

six books on light and shade
linear perspective cannot be immediately followed by either the
prospettiva de perdimenti or the prospettiva de colori or
the aerial perspective since these branches of the subject
presuppose a knowledge of the principles of light and shade no
apology therefore is here needed for placing these immediately
after linear perspective
we have various plans suggested by leonardo for the arrangement of
the mass of materials treating of this subject among these i have
given the preference to a scheme propounded in no iii because
in all probability we have here a final and definite purpose
expressed several authors have expressed it as their opinion that
the paris manuscript c is a complete and finished treatise on
light and shade certainly the principles of light and shade form
by far the larger portion of this ms which consists of two separate
parts still the materials are far from being finally arranged it
is also evident that he here investigates the subject from the point
of view of the physicist rather than from that of the painter
the plan of a scheme of arrangement suggested in no iii and
adopted by me has been strictly adhered to for the first four books
for the three last however few materials have come down to us and
it must be admitted that these three books would find a far more
appropriate place in a work on physics than in a treatise on
painting for this reason i have collected in book v all the
chapters on reflections and in book vi i have put together and
arranged all the sections of ms c that belong to the book on
painting so far as they relate to light and shade while the
sections of the same ms which treat of the prospettiva de
perdimenti have of course been excluded from the series on light
and shade
footnote iii this text has already been published with some slight
variations in dozios pamphlet degli scritti e disegni di leonardo

introduction
having already treated of the nature of shadows and the way in
which they are cast footnote 2 avendo io tractatowe may
suppose that he here refers to some particular ms possibly paris
c i will now consider the places on which they fall and their
curvature obliquity flatness or in short any character i may be
able to detect in them
shadow is the obstruction of light shadows appear to me to be of
supreme importance in perspective because without them opaque and
solid bodies will be ill defined that which is contained within
their outlines and their boundaries themselves will be
illunderstood unless they are shown against a background of a
different tone from themselves and therefore in my first
proposition concerning shadow i state that every opaque body is
surrounded and its whole surface enveloped in shadow and light and
on this proposition i build up the first book besides this shadows
have in themselves various degrees of darkness because they are
caused by the absence of a variable amount of the luminous rays and
these i call primary shadows because they are the first and
inseparable from the object to which they belong and on this i will
found my second book from these primary shadows there result
certain shaded rays which are diffused through the atmosphere and
these vary in character according to that of the primary shadows
whence they are derived i shall therefore call these shadows
derived shadows because they are produced by other shadows and the
third book will treat of these again these derived shadows where
they are intercepted by various objects produce effects as various
as the places where they are cast and of this i will treat in the
fourth book and since all round the derived shadows where the
derived shadows are intercepted there is always a space where the
light falls and by reflected dispersion is thrown back towards its
cause it meets the original shadow and mingles with it and modifies
it somewhat in its nature and on this i will compose my fifth book
besides this in the sixth book i will investigate the many and
various diversities of reflections resulting from these rays which
will modify the original shadow by imparting some of the various
colours from the different objects whence these reflected rays are
derived again the seventh book will treat of the various distances
that may exist between the spot where the reflected rays fall and
that where they originate and the various shades of colour which
they will acquire in falling on opaque bodies
different principles and plans of treatment 112116
112
first i will treat of light falling through windows which i will
call restricted light and then i will treat of light in the open
country to which i will give the name of diffused light then i
will treat of the light of luminous bodies
113
of painting
the conditions of shadow and light as seen by the eye are 3 of
these the first is when the eye and the light are on the same side
of the object seen the 2nd is when the eye is in front of the
object and the light is behind it the 3rd is when the eye is in
front of the object and the light is on one side in such a way as
that a line drawn from the object to the eye and one from the object
to the light should form a right angle where they meet
114
of painting
this is another section that is of the nature of a reflection
from an object placed between the eye and the light under various
aspects
115
of painting
as regards all visible objects 3 things must be considered these
are the position of the eye which sees that of the object seen
with regard to the light and the position of the light which
illuminates the object b is the eye a the object seen c the
light a is the eye b the illuminating body c is the
illuminated object
116
let a be the light b the eye c the object seen by the eye
and in the light these show first the eye between the light and
the body the 2nd the light between the eye and the body the 3rd
the body between the eye and the light a is the eye b the
illuminated object c the light
117
of painting
of the three kinds of light that illuminate opaque bodies
the first kind of light which may illuminate opaque bodies is called
direct lightas that of the sun or any other light from a window or
flame the second is diffused universal light such as we see in
cloudy weather or in mist and the like the 3rd is subdued light
that is when the sun is entirely below the horizon either in the
evening or morning
118
of light
the lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds these
are diffused light as that of the atmosphere within our horizon
and direct as that of the sun or of a window or door or other
opening the third is reflected light and there is a 4th which is
that which passes through semi transparent bodies as linen or
paper or the like but not transparent like glass or crystal or
other diaphanous bodies which produce the same effect as though
nothing intervened between the shaded object and the light that
falls upon it and this we will discuss fully in our discourse
definition of the nature of shadows 119122
119
what light and shadow are
shadow is the absence of light merely the obstruction of the
luminous rays by an opaque body shadow is of the nature of
darkness light on an object is of the nature of a luminous body
one conceals and the other reveals they are always associated and
inseparable from all objects but shadow is a more powerful agent
than light for it can impede and entirely deprive bodies of their
light while light can never entirely expel shadow from a body that
is from an opaque body
120
shadow is the diminution of light by the intervention of an opaque
body shadow is the counterpart of the luminous rays which are cut
off by an opaque body
this is proved because the shadow cast is the same in shape and size
as the luminous rays were which are transformed into a shadow
121
shadow is the diminution alike of light and of darkness and stands
between darkness and light
a shadow may be infinitely dark and also of infinite degrees of
absence of darkness
the beginnings and ends of shadow lie between the light and darkness
and may be infinitely diminished and infinitely increased shadow is
the means by which bodies display their form
the forms of bodies could not be understood in detail but for
shadow
122
of the nature of shadow
shadow partakes of the nature of universal matter all such matters
are more powerful in their beginning and grow weaker towards the
end i say at the beginning whatever their form or condition may be
and whether visible or invisible and it is not from small
beginnings that they grow to a great size in time as it might be a
great oak which has a feeble beginning from a small acorn yet i may
say that the oak is most powerful at its beginning that is where it
springs from the earth which is where it is largest to return
darkness then is the strongest degree of shadow and light is its
least therefore o painter make your shadow darkest close to the
object that casts it and make the end of it fading into light
seeming to have no end
of the various kinds of shadows 123125
123
darkness is absence of light shadow is diminution of light
primitive shadow is that which is inseparable from a body not in the
light derived shadow is that which is disengaged from a body in
shadow and pervades the air a cast transparent shadow is that which
is surrounded by an illuminated surface a simple shadow is one
which receives no light from the luminous body which causes it a
simple shadow begins within the line which starts from the edge of
the luminous body a b
124
a simple shadow is one where no light at all interferes with it
a compound shadow is one which is somewhat illuminated by one or
more lights
125
what is the difference between a shadow that is inseparable from a
body and a cast shadow
an inseparable shadow is that which is never absent from the
illuminated body as for instance a ball which so long as it is in
the light always has one side in shadow which never leaves it for
any movement or change of position in the ball a separate shadow
may be and may not be produced by the body itself suppose the ball
to be one braccia distant from a wall with a light on the opposite
side of it this light will throw upon the wall exactly as broad a
shadow as is to be seen on the side of the ball that is turned
towards the wall that portion of the cast shadow will not be
visible when the light is below the ball and the shadow is thrown up
towards the sky and finding no obstruction on its way is lost
126
how there are 2 kinds of light one separable from and the other
inseparable from bodies
of the various kinds of light 126 127
separate light is that which falls upon the body inseparable light
is the side of the body that is illuminated by that light one is
called primary the other derived and in the same way there are
two kinds of shadowone primary and the other derived the primary
is that which is inseparable from the body the derived is that
which proceeds from the body conveying to the surface of the wall
the form of the body causing it
127
how there are 2 different kinds of light one being called diffused
the other restricted the diffused is that which freely illuminates
objects the restricted is that which being admitted through an
opening or window illuminates them on that side only
footnote at the spot marked a in the first diagram leonardo
wrote lume costretto restricted light at the spot b on the
second diagram he wrote lume libero diffused light
general remarks 128 129
128
light is the chaser away of darkness shade is the obstruction of
light primary light is that which falls on objects and causes light
and shade and derived lights are those portions of a body which are
illuminated by the primary light a primary shadow is that side of a
body on which the light cannot fall
the general distribution of shadow and light is that sum total of
the rays thrown off by a shaded or illuminated body passing through
the air without any interference and the spot which intercepts and
cuts off the distribution of the dark and light rays
and the eye can best distinguish the forms of objects when it is
placed between the shaded and the illuminated parts
129
memorandum of things i require to have granted as axioms in my
explanation of perspective
i ask to have this much granted meto assert that every ray
passing through air of equal density throughout travels in a
straight line from its cause to the object or place it falls upon
first book on light and shade
on the nature of light 130 131
130
the reason by which we know that a light radiates from a single
centre is this we plainly see that a large light is often much
broader than some small object which neverthelessand although the
rays of the large light are much more than twice the extent of
the small bodyalways has its shadow cast on the nearest surface
very visibly let c f be a broad light and n be the object in
front of it casting a shadow on the plane and let a b be the
plane it is clear that it is not the broad light that will cast the
shadow n on the plane but that the light has within it a centre
is shown by this experiment the shadow falls on the plane as is
shown at m o t r
footnote 13 in the original ms no explanatory text is placed
after this titleline but a space is left for it and the text
beginning at line 15 comes next why to two eyes or in front of
two eyes do 3 objects appear as two
why when you estimate the direction of an object with two sights
the nearer appears confused i say that the eye projects an infinite
number of lines which mingle or join those reaching it which come to
it from the object looked at and it is only the central and
sensible line that can discern and discriminate colours and objects
all the others are false and illusory and if you place 2 objects at
half an arms length apart if the nearer of the two is close to the
eye its form will remain far more confused than that of the second
the reason is that the first is overcome by a greater number of
false lines than the second and so is rendered vague
light acts in the same manner for in the effects of its lines
rays and particularly in perspective it much resembles the eye
and its central rays are what cast the true shadow when the object
in front of it is too quickly overcome with dim rays it will cast a
broad and disproportionate shadow ill defined but when the object
which is to cast the shadow and cuts off the rays near to the place
where the shadow falls then the shadow is distinct and the more so
in proportion as the light is far off because at a long distance
the central ray is less overcome by false rays because the lines
from the eye and the solar and other luminous rays passing through
the atmosphere are obliged to travel in straight lines unless they
are deflected by a denser or rarer air when they will be bent at
some point but so long as the air is free from grossness or
moisture they will preserve their direct course always carrying the
image of the object that intercepts them back to their point of
origin and if this is the eye the intercepting object will be seen
by its colour as well as by form and size but if the intercepting
plane has in it some small perforation opening into a darker
chambernot darker in colour but by absence of lightyou will see
the rays enter through this hole and transmitting to the plane
beyond all the details of the object they proceed from both as to
colour and form only every thing will be upside down but the size
of the image where the lines are reconstructed will be in
proportion to the relative distance of the aperture from the plane
on which the lines fall on one hand and from their origin on the
other there they intersect and form 2 pyramids with their point
meeting a common apex and their bases opposite let a b be the
point of origin of the lines d e the first plane and c the
aperture with the intersection of the lines f g is the inner
plane you will find that a falls upon the inner plane below at
g and b which is below will go up to the spot f it will be
quite evident to experimenters that every luminous body has in
itself a core or centre from which and to which all the lines
radiate which are sent forth by the surface of the luminous body and
reflected back to it or which having been thrown out and not
intercepted are dispersed in the air
131
the rays whether shaded or luminous have greater strength and effect
at their points than at their sides
although the points of luminous pyramids may extend into shaded
places and those of pyramids of shadow into illuminated places and
though among the luminous pyramids one may start from a broader base
than another nevertheless if by reason of their various length
these luminous pyramids acquire angles of equal size their light
will be equal and the case will be the same with the pyramids of
shadow as may be seen in the intersected pyramids a b c and d e
f which though their bases differ in size are equal as to breadth
and light

the difference between light and lustre 132135
132
of the difference between light and lustre and that lustre is not
included among colours but is saturation of whiteness and derived
from the surface of wet bodies light partakes of the colour of the
object which reflects it to the eye as gold or silver or the like
133
of the highest lights which turn and move as the eye moves which
sees the object
suppose the body to be the round object figured here and let the
light be at the point a and let the illuminated side of the
object be b c and the eye at the point d i say that as lustre
is every where and complete in each part if you stand at the point
d the lustre will appear at c and in proportion as the eye
moves from d to a the lustre will move from c to n
134
of painting
heigh light or lustre on any object is not situated necessarily in
the middle of an illuminated object but moves as and where the eye
moves in looking at it
135
of light and lustre
what is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on
the polished surface of opaque bodies
the lights which are produced from the polished surface of opaque
bodies will be stationary on stationary objects even if the eye on
which they strike moves but reflected lights will on those same
objects appear in as many different places on the surface as
different positions are taken by the eye
what bodies have light upon them without lustre
opaque bodies which have a hard and rough surface never display any
lustre in any portion of the side on which the light falls
what bodies will display lustre but not look illuminated
those bodies which are opaque and hard with a hard surface reflect
light lustre from every spot on the illuminated side which is in a
position to receive light at the same angle of incidence as they
occupy with regard to the eye but as the surface mirrors all the
surrounding objects the illuminated body is not recognisable in
these portions of the illuminated body
136
the relations of luminous to illuminated bodies
the middle of the light and shade on an object in light and shade is
opposite to the middle of the primary light all light and shadow
expresses itself in pyramidal lines the middle of the shadow on any
object must necessarily be opposite the middle of its light with a
direct line passing through the centre of the body the middle of
the light will be at a that of the shadow at b again in
bodies shown in light and shade the middle of each must coincide
with the centre of the body and a straight line will pass through
both and through that centre

nevertheless if you follow the lines of their shadows you will see
they intersect at a point forming the angle n

138
every shadow cast by a body has a central line directed to a single
point produced by the intersection of luminous lines in the middle
of the opening and thickness of the window the proposition stated
above is plainly seen by experiment thus if you draw a place with
a window looking northwards and let this be s f you will see a
line starting from the horizon to the east which touching the 2
angles of the window o f reaches d and from the horizon on the
west another line touching the other 2 angles r s and ending at
c and their intersection falls exactly in the middle of the
opening and thickness of the window again you can still better
confirm this proof by placing two sticks as shown at g h and you
will see the line drawn from the centre of the shadow directed to
the centre m and prolonged to the horizon n f

139
every shadow with all its variations which becomes larger as its
distance from the object is greater has its external lines
intersecting in the middle between the light and the object this
proposition is very evident and is confirmed by experience for if
a b is a window without any object interposed the luminous
atmosphere to the right hand at a is seen to the left at d and
the atmosphere at the left illuminates on the right at c and the
lines intersect at the point m

every body in light and shade is situated between 2 pyramids one
dark and the other luminous one is visible the other is not but
this only happens when the light enters by a window supposing a b
to be the window and r the body in light and shade the light to
the right hand z will pass the object to the left and go on to
p the light to the left at k will pass to the right of the
object at i and go on to m and the two lines will intersect at
c and form a pyramid then again a b falls on the shaded body
at i g and forms a pyramid f i g f will be dark because
the light a b can never fall there i g c will be
illuminated because the light falls upon it

illuminated by it these objects will be seen without any shadow

light which surrounds the body in shadow will see that the deepest
shadows on that body will meet the eye at equal angles that is at
the same angle as that of sight

of the different light and shade in various aspects and of objects
placed in them
if the sun is in the east and you look towards the west you will see
every thing in full light and totally without shadow because you see
them from the same side as the sun and if you look towards the
south or north you will see all objects in light and shade because
you see both the side towards the sun and the side away from it and
if you look towards the coming of the sun all objects will show you
their shaded side because on that side the sun cannot fall upon
them

the light which falls on a shaded body at the acutest angle receives
the highest light and the darkest portion is that which receives it
at an obtuse angle and both the light and the shadow form pyramids
the angle c receives the highest grade of light because it is
directly in front of the window a b and the whole horizon of the
sky m x the angle a differs but little from c because the
angles which divide it are not so unequal as those below and only
that portion of the horizon is intercepted which lies between y
and x although it gains as much on the other side its line is
nevertheless not very strong because one angle is smaller than its
fellow the angles e i will have less light because they do not
see much of the light m s and the light v x and their angles are
very unequal yhe angle k and the angle f are each placed
between very unequal angles and therefore have but little light
because at k it has only the light p t and at f only t q
o g is the lowest grade of light because this part has no light at
all from the sky and thence come the lines which will reconstruct a
pyramid that is the counterpart of the pyramid c and this pyramid
l is in the first grade of shadow for this too is placed between
equal angles directly opposite to each other on either side of a
straight line which passes through the centre of the body and goes
to the centre of the light the several luminous images cast within
the frame of the window at the points a and b make a light which
surrounds the derived shadow cast by the solid body at the points 4

150
the smaller the light that falls upon an object the more shadow it
will display and the light will illuminate a smaller portion of the
object in proportion as it is nearer to it and conversely a larger
extent of it in proportion as it is farther off
a light which is smaller than the object on which it falls will
light up a smaller extent of it in proportion as it is nearer to it
and the converse as it is farther from it but when the light is
larger than the object illuminated it will light a larger extent of
the object in proportion as it is nearer and the converse when they
are farther apart

among objects in various degrees of shade when the light proceeds
from a single source there will be the same proportion in their
shadows as in the natural diminution of the light and the same must
be understood of the degrees of light

a single and distinct luminous body causes stronger relief in the
object than a diffused light as may be seen by comparing one side
of a landscape illuminated by the sun and one overshadowed by
clouds and so illuminated only by the diffused light of the
atmosphere
third book on light and shade
definition of derived shadow 158 159
158
derived shadow cannot exist without primary shadow this is proved
by the first of this which says darkness is the total absence of
light and shadow is an alleviation of darkness and of light and it
is more or less dark or light in proportion as the darkness is
modified by the light
159
shadow is diminution of light
darkness is absence of light
shadow is divided into two kinds of which the first is called
primary shadow the second is derived shadow the primary shadow is
always the basis of the derived shadow
the edges of the derived shadow are straight lines
footnote the theory of the ombra dirivativaa technical
expression for which there is no precise english equivalent is
elaborately treated by leonardo but both text and diagrams as pl
iv 13 and pl v must at once convince the student that the
distinction he makes between ombra primitiva and ombra
dirivativa is not merely justifiable but scientific ombra
dirivativa is by no means a mere abstract idea this is easily
proved by repeating the experiment made by leonardo and by filling
with smoke the room in which the existence of the ombra dirivativa
is investigated when the shadow becomes visible nor is it
difficult to perceive how much of leonardos teaching depended on
this theory the recognised but extremely complicated science of
cast shadowspercussione dell ombre dirivative as leonardo
calls themis thus rendered more intelligible if not actually
simpler and we must assume this theory as our chief guide through
the investigations which follow
the darkness of the derived shadow diminishes in proportion as it is
remote from the primary shadow
different sorts of derived shadows 160162
160
shadow and light
the forms of shadows are three inasmuch as if the solid body which
casts the shadow is equal in size to the light the shadow
resembles a column without any termination in length if the body
is larger than the light the shadow resembles a truncated and
inverted pyramid and its length has also no defined termination
but if the body is smaller than the light the shadow will resemble
a pyramid and come to an end as is seen in eclipses of the moon
161
of simple derived shadows
the simple derived shadow is of two kinds one kind which has its
length defined and two kinds which are undefined and the defined
shadow is pyramidal of the two undefined one is a column and the
other spreads out and all three have rectilinear outlines but the
converging that is the pyramidal shadow proceeds from a body that
is smaller than the light and the columnar from a body equal in
size to the light and the spreading shadow from a body larger than
the light c
of compound derived shadows
compound derived shadows are of two kinds that is columnar and
spreading
162
of shadow
derived shadows are of three kinds of which one is spreading the
second columnar the third converging to the point where the two
sides meet and intersect and beyond this intersection the sides are
infinitely prolonged or straight lines and if you say this shadow
must terminate at the angle where the sides meet and extend no
farther i deny this because above in the first on shadow i have
proved that a thing is completely terminated when no portion of it
goes beyond its terminating lines now here in this shadow we see
the converse of this in as much as where this derived shadow
originates we obviously have the figures of two pyramids of shadow
which meet at their angles hence if as my opponent says the
first pyramid of shadow terminates the derivative shadow at the
angle whence it starts then the second pyramid of shadowso says
the adversarymust be caused by the angle and not from the body in
shadow and this is disproved with the help of the 2nd of this which
says shadow is a condition produced by a body casting a shadow and
interposed between this shadow and the luminous body by this it is
made clear that the shadow is not produced by the angle of the
derived shadow but only by the body casting the shadow c if a
spherical solid body is illuminated by a light of elongated form the
shadow produced by the longest portion of this light will have less
defined outlines than that which is produced by the breadth of the
same light and this is proved by what was said before which is
that a shadow will have less defined outlines in proportion as the
light which causes it is larger and conversely the outlines are
clearer in proportion as it is smaller
footnote the two diagrams to this chapter are on plate iv no 1
on the relation of derived and primary shadow 163165
163
the derived shadow can never resemble the body from which it
proceeds unless the light is of the same form and size as the body
causing the shadow
the derived shadow cannot be of the same form as the primary shadow
unless it is intercepted by a plane parallel to it
164
how a cast shadow can never be of the same size as the body that
casts it
if the rays of light proceed as experience shows from a single
point and are diffused in a sphere round this point radiating and
dispersed through the air the farther they spread the wider they
must spread and an object placed between the light and a wall is
always imaged larger in its shadow because the rays that strike it
footnote 7 the following lines are wanting to complete the
logical connection would by the time they have reached the wall
have become larger
165
any shadow cast by a body in light and shade is of the same nature
and character as that which is inseparable from the body the centre
of the length of a shadow always corresponds to that of the luminous
body footnote 6 this second statement of the same idea as in the
former sentence but in different words does not in the original
come next to the foregoing sections 172 and 127 are placed between
them it is inevitable that every shadow must have its centre in a
line with the centre of the light
on the shape of derived shadows 166174
166
of the pyramidal shadow
the pyramidal shadow produced by a columnar body will be narrower
than the body itself in proportion as the simple derived shadow is
intersected farther from the body which casts it
footnote 166 compare the first diagram to no 161 if we here
conceive of the outlines of the pyramid of shadow on the ground as
prolonged beyond its apex this gives rise to a second pyramid this
is what is spoken of at the beginning of no 166
167
the cast shadow will be longest when the light is lowest
the cast shadow will be shortest when the light is highest
168
both the primary and derived shadow will be larger when caused by
the light of a candle than by diffused light the difference between
the larger and smaller shadows will be in inverse proportion to the
larger and smaller lights causing them
footnote in the diagrams a stands for celo sky b for
cadela candle
169
all bodies in proportion as they are nearer to or farther from the
source of light will produce longer or shorter derived shadows
among bodies of equal size that one which is illuminated by the
largest light will have the shortest shadow experiment confirms
this proposition thus the body m n is surrounded by a larger
amount of light than the body p q as is shown above let us say
that v c a b d x is the sky the source of light and that s t
is a window by which the luminous rays enter and so m n and p q
are bodies in light and shade as exposed to this light m n will
have a small derived shadow because its original shadow will be
small and the derivative light will be large again because the
original light c d will be large and p q will have more derived
shadow because its original shadow will be larger and its derived
light will be smaller than that of the body m n because that
portion of the hemisphere a b which illuminates it is smaller than
the hemisphere c d which illuminates the body m n

the shadow m bears the same proportion to the shadow n as the

171
of painting
of different shadows of equal strength that which is nearest the eye
will seem the least strong
why is the shadow e a b in the first grade of strength b c in
the second c d in the third the reason is that as from e a b
the sky is nowhere visible it gets no light whatever from the sky
and so has no direct primary light b c faces the portion of the
sky f g and is illuminated by it c d faces the sky at h k c
d being exposed to a larger extent of sky than b c it is
reasonable that it should be more lighted and thus up to a certain
distance the wall a d will grow lighter for the reasons here
given until the darkness of the room overpowers the light from the
window
172
when the light of the atmosphere is restricted by an opening and
illuminates bodies which cast shadows these bodies being equally
distant from the centre of the window that which is most obliquely
placed will cast the largest shadow beyond it
173
these bodies standing apart in a room lighted by a single window
will have derivative shadows more or less short according as they
are more or less opposite to the window among the shadows cast by
bodies of equal mass but at unequal distances from the opening by
which they are illuminated that shadow will be the longest of the
body which is least in the light and in proportion as one body is
better illuminated than another its shadow will be shorter than
another the proportion n m and e v k bear to r t and v x
corresponds with that of the shadow x to 4 and y
the reason why those bodies which are placed most in front of the
middle of the window throw shorter shadows than those obliquely
situated isthat the window appears in its proper form and to the
obliquely placed ones it appears foreshortened to those in the
middle the window shows its full size to the oblique ones it
appears smaller the one in the middle faces the whole hemisphere
that is e f and those on the side have only a strip that is q r
faces a b and m n faces c d the body in the middle having a
larger quantity of light than those at the sides is lighted from a
point much below its centre and thus the shadow is shorter and the
pyramid g 4 goes into l y exactly as often as a b goes into e
f the axis of every derivative shadow passes through 6 12
footnote 31 passa per 6 12 passes through 6 12 the meaning
of these words is probably this each of the three axes of the
derived shadow intersects the centre mezzo of the primary shadow
ombra originale and by prolongation upwards crosses six lines
this is self evident only in the middle diagram but it is equally
true of the side figures if we conceive of the lines 4 f x n v
m y l k v and 4 e as prolonged beyond the semicircle of the
horizon and is in a straight line with the centre of the primary
shadow with the centre of the body casting it and of the derivative
light and with the centre of the window and finally with the
centre of that portion of the source of light which is the celestial
hemisphere y h is the centre of the derived shade l h of the
primary shadow l of the body throwing it l k of the derived
light v is the centre of the window e is the final centre of
the original light afforded by that portion of the hemisphere of the
sky which illuminates the solid body
footnote compare the diagram on pl iv no 3 in the original
this drawing is placed between lines 3 and 22 the rest from line 4
to line 21 is written on the left hand margin
174
the farther the derived shadow is prolonged the lighter it becomes
you will find that the proportion of the diameter of the derived
shadow to that of the primary shadow will be the same as that
between the darkness of the primary shadow and that of the derived
shadow
footnote 6 compare no 177 let a b be the diameter of the
primary shadow and c d that of the derived shadow i say that a
b going as you see three times into d c the shadow d c will
be three times as light as the shadow a b footnote 8 compare

if the size of the illuminating body is larger than that of the
illuminated body an intersection of shadow will occur beyond which
the shadows will run off in two opposite directions as if they were
caused by two separate lights

175
on painting
the derived shadow is stronger in proportion as it is nearer to its
place of origin
176
how shadows fade away at long distances
shadows fade and are lost at long distances because the larger
quantity of illuminated air which lies between the eye and the
object seen tints the shadow with its own colour
177
a b will be darker than c d in proportion as c d is broader
than a b
footnote in the original ms the word lume light is written at
the apex of the pyramid
178
it can be proved why the shadow o p c h is darker in proportion as
it is nearer to the line p h and is lighter in proportion as it is
nearer to the line o c let the light a b be a window and let
the dark wall in which this window is be b s that is one of the
sides of the wall
then we may say that the line p h is darker than any other part of
the space o p c h because this line faces the whole surface in
shadow of footnote in the original the diagram is placed between
lines 27 and 28 the wall b s the line o c is lighter than the
other part of this space o p c h because this line faces the

where the shadow is larger or smaller or equal the body which
casts it

divisi the text here breaks off abruptly
of the compound shadow f r c h caused by a single light
the shadow f r c h is under such conditions as that where it is
farthest from its inner side it loses depth in proportion to prove
this
let d a be the light and f n the solid body and let a e be
one of the side walls of the window that is d a then i
sayaccording to the 2nd proposition that the surface of any
body is affected by the tone of the objects surrounding itthat
the side r c which faces the dark wall a e must participate of
its darkness and in the same way that the outer surface which faces
the light d a participates of the light thus we get the outlines
of the extremes on each side of the centre included between them
this is divided into four parts the first the extremes which
include the compound shadow secondly the compound shadow between
these extremes
179
the action of the light as from its centre
if it were the whole of the light that caused the shadows beyond the
bodies placed in front of it it would follow that any body much
smaller than the light would cast a pyramidal shadow but experience
not showing this it must be the centre of the light that produces
this effect

shadow as produced by two lights of different size 180 181
180
a body in light and shade placed between two equal lights side by
side will cast shadows in proportion to the amount of light and
the shadows will be one darker than the other in proportion as one
light is nearer to the said body than the other on the opposite
side
a body placed at an equal distance between two lights will cast two
shadows one deeper than the other in proportion as the light which
causes it is brighter than the other
footnote in the ms the larger diagram is placed above the first
line the smaller one between l 4  5
181
a light which is smaller than the body it illuminates produces
shadows of which the outlines end within the surface of the body
and not much compound shadow and falls on less than half of it a
light which is larger than the body it illuminates falls on more
than half of it and produces much compound shadow
the effect of light at different distances
182
of the shadow cast by a body placed between 2 equal lights
a body placed between 2 equal lights will cast 2 shadows of itself
in the direction of the lines of the 2 lights and if you move this
body placing it nearer to one of the lights the shadow cast towards
the nearer light will be less deep than that which falls towards the
more distant one
further complications in the derived shadows 183187
183
the greatest depth of shadow is in the simple derived shadow because
it is not lighted by either of the two lights a b c d
the next less deep shadow is the derived shadow e f n and in this
the shadow is less by half because it is illuminated by a single
light that is c d
this is uniform in natural tone because it is lighted throughout by
one only of the two luminous bodies 10 but it varies with the
conditions of shadow inasmuch as the farther it is away from the
light the less it is illuminated by it 13
the third degree of depth is the middle shadow footnote 15 we
gather from what follows that q g r here means ombra media the
middle shadow but this is not uniform in natural tone because
the nearer it gets to the simple derived shadow the deeper it is
footnote 18 compare lines 1013 and it is the uniformly gradual
diminution by increase of distance which is what modifies it
footnote 20 see footnote 18 that is to say the depth of a shadow
increases in proportion to the distance from the two lights
the fourth is the shadow k r s and this is all the darker in
natural tone in proportion as it is nearer to k s because it gets
less of the light a o but by the accident of distance it is
rendered less deep because it is nearer to the light c d and
thus is always exposed to both lights
the fifth is less deep in shadow than either of the others because
it is always entirely exposed to one of the lights and to the whole
or part of the other and it is less deep in proportion as it is
nearer to the two lights and in proportion as it is turned towards
the outer side x t because it is more exposed to the second light

of simple shadows
why at the intersections a b of the two compound shadows e f
and m e is a simple shadow pfoduced as at e h and m g while
no such simple shadow is produced at the other two intersections c
d made by the very same compound shadows
answer
compound shadow are a mixture of light and shade and simple shadows
are simply darkness hence of the two lights n and o one falls
on the compound shadow from one side and the other on the compound
shadow from the other side but where they intersect no light falls
as at a b therefore it is a simple shadow where there is a
compound shadow one light or the other falls and here a difficulty
arises for my adversary since he says that where the compound
shadows intersect both the lights which produce the shadows must of
necessity fall and therefore these shadows ought to be neutralised
inasmuch as the two lights do not fall there we say that the shadow
is a simple one and where only one of the two lights falls we say
the shadow is compound and where both the lights fall the shadow is
neutralised for where both lights fall no shadow of any kind is
produced but only a light background limiting the shadow here i
shall say that what my adversary said was true but he only mentions
such truths as are in his favour and if we go on to the rest he
must conclude that my proposition is true and that is that if both
lights fell on the point of intersection the shadows would be
neutralised this i confess to be true if neither of the two
shadows fell in the same spot because where a shadow and a light
fall a compound shadow is produced and wherever two shadows or two
equal lights fall the shadow cannot vary in any part of it the
shadows and the lights both being equal and this is proved in the
eighth proposition on proportion where it is said that if a given
quantity has a single unit of force and resistance a double
quantity will have double force and double resistance
definition
the intersection n is produced by the shadows caused by the light
b because this light b produces the shadow x b and the
shadow s b but the intersection m is produced by the light a
which causes the shadow s a and the shadow x a
but if you uncover both the lights a b then you get the two
shadows n m both at once and besides these two other simple
shadows are produced at r o where neither of the two lights falls
at all the grades of depth in compound shadows are fewer in
proportion as the lights falling on and crossing them are less
numerous
186
why the intersections at n being composed of two compound derived
shadows forms a compound shadow and not a simple one as happens
with other intersections of compound shadows this occurs according
to the 2nd diagram of this prop which saysthe intersection
of derived shadows when produced by the intersection of columnar
shadows caused by a single light does not produce a simple shadow
and this is the corollary of the 1st prop which saysthe
intersection of simple derived shadows never results in a deeper
shadow because the deepest shadows all added together cannot be
darker than one by itself since if many deepest shadows increased
in depth by their duplication they could not be called the
deepest shadows but only partshadows but if such intersections
are illuminated by a second light placed between the eye and the
intersecting bodies then those shadows would become compound
shadows and be uniformly dark just as much at the intersection as
throughout the rest in the 1st and 2nd above the intersections i
k will not be doubled in depth as it is doubled in quantity but in
this 3rd at the intersections g n they will be double in depth
and in quantity
187
how and when the surroundings in shadow mingle their derived shadow
with the light derived from the luminous body
the derived shadow of the dark walls on each side of the bright
light of the window are what mingle their various degrees of shade
with the light derived from the window and these various depths of
shade modify every portion of the light except where it is
strongest at c to prove this let d a be the primary shadow
which is turned towards the point e and darkens it by its derived
shadow as may be seen by the triangle a e d in which the
angle e faces the darkened base d a e the point v faces the
dark shadow a s which is part of a d and as the whole is
greater than a part e which faces the whole base of the
triangle will be in deeper shadow than v which only faces part
of it in consequence of the conclusion shown in the above
diagram t will be less darkened than v because the base of the
t is part of the base of the v and in the same way it follows
that p is less in shadow than t because the base of the p is
part of the base of the t and c is the terminal point of the
derived shadow and the chief beginning of the highest light

if a window a b admits the sunlight into a room the sunlight will
magnify the size of the window and diminish the shadow of a man in
such a way as that when the man makes that dim shadow of himself
approach to that which defines the real size of the window he will
see the shadows where they come into contact dim and confused from
the strength of the light shutting off and not allowing the solar
rays to pass the effect of the shadow of the man cast by this
contact will be exactly that figured above
footnote it is scarcely possible to render the meaning of this
sentence with strict accuracy mainly because the grammatical
construction is defective in the most important partline 4 in the
very slight original sketch the shadow touches the upper arch of the
window and the correction here given is perhaps not justified
191
a shadow is never seen as of uniform depth on the surface which
intercepts it unless every portion of that surface is equidistant
from the luminous body this is proved by the 7th which saysthe
shadow will appear lighter or stronger as it is surrounded by a
darker or a lighter background and by the 8th of thisthe
background will be in parts darker or lighter in proportion as it
is farther from or nearer to the luminous body andof various
spots equally distant from the luminous body those will always be in
the highest light on which the rays fall at the smallest angles the
outline of the shadow as it falls on inequalities in the surface
will be seen with all the contours similar to those of the body that
casts it if the eye is placed just where the centre of the light
was
the shadow will look darkest where it is farthest from the body that
casts it the shadow c d cast by the body in shadow a b which
is equally distant in all parts is not of equal depth because it is
seen on a back ground of varying brightness footnote compare the

why
if an object placed in front of a single light is very close to it
you will see that it casts a very large shadow on the opposite wall
and the farther you remove the object from the light the smaller
will the image of the shadow become
why a shadow larger than the body that produces it becomes out of
proportion
the disproportion of a shadow which is larger than the body
producing it results from the light being smaller than the body so
that it cannot be at an equal distance from the edges of the body
footnote 11 h ludwig in his edition of the old copies in the
vatican libraryin which this chapter is included under nos 612
613 and 614 alters this passage as follows quella parte che piu
propinqua piu cresce che le distanti although the vatican copy
agrees with the original ms in having distante in the former and
propinque in the latter place this supposed amendment seems to me
to invert the facts supposing for instance that on pl xxxi no 3
f is the spot where the light is that illuminates the figure there
represented and that the line behind the figure represents a wall
on which the shadow of the figure is thrown it is evident that in
that case the nearest portion in this case the under part of the
thigh is very little magnified in the shadow and the remoter
parts for instance the head are more magnified and the portions
which are most remote are made larger than the nearer portions for
this reason footnote 12 see footnote 11
why a shadow which is larger than the body causing it has
illdefined outlines
the atmosphere which surrounds a light is almost like light itself
for brightness and colour but the farther off it is the more it
loses this resemblance an object which casts a large shadow and is
near to the light is illuminated both by that light by the luminous
atmosphere hence this diffused light gives the shadow illdefined
edges
197
a luminous body which is long and narrow in shape gives more
confused outlines to the derived shadow than a spherical light and
this contradicts the proposition next following a shadow will have
its outlines more clearly defined in proportion as it is nearer to
the primary shadow or i should say the body casting the shadow

of modified shadows
modified shadows are those which are cast on light walls or other
illuminated objects
a shadow looks darkest against a light background the outlines of a
derived shadow will be clearer as they are nearer to the primary
shadow a derived shadow will be most defined in shape where it is
intercepted where the plane intercepts it at the most equal angle
those parts of a shadow will appear darkest which have darker
objects opposite to them and they will appear less dark when they
face lighter objects and the larger the light object opposite the
more the shadow will be lightened
and the larger the surface of the dark object the more it will
darken the derived shadow where it is intercepted
a disputed proposition
199
of the opinion of some that a triangle casts no shadow on a plane
surface
certain mathematicians have maintained that a triangle of which the
base is turned to the light casts no shadow on a plane and this
they prove by saying 5 that no spherical body smaller than the
light can reach the middle with the shadow the lines of radiant
light are straight lines 6 therefore suppose the light to be g
h and the triangle l m n and let the plane be i k they say
the light g falls on the side of the triangle l n and the
portion of the plane i q thus again h like g falls on the
side l m and then on m n and the plane p k and if the whole
plane thus faces the lights g h it is evident that the triangle
has no shadow and that which has no shadow can cast none this in
this case appears credible but if the triangle n p g were not
illuminated by the two lights g and h but by i p and g and
k neither side is lighted by more than one single light that is
i p is invisible to h g and k will never be lighted by g
hence p q will be twice as light as the two visible portions that
are in shadow

fifth book on light and shade
principles of reflection 203 204
203
of the way in which the shadows cast by objects ought to be defined
if the object is the mountain here figured and the light is at the
point a i say that from b d and also from c f there will be
no light but from reflected rays and this results from the fact
that rays of light can only act in straight lines and the same is
the case with the secondary or reflected rays
204
the edges of the derived shadow are defined by the hues of the
illuminated objects surrounding the luminous body which produces the
shadow
on reverberation
205
of reverberation
reverberation is caused by bodies of a bright nature with a flat and
semi opaque surface which when the light strikes upon them throw
it back again like the rebound of a ball to the former object
where there can be no reflected lights
all dense bodies have their surfaces occupied by various degrees of
light and shade the lights are of two kinds one called original
the other borrowed original light is that which is inherent in the
flame of fire or the light of the sun or of the atmosphere borrowed
light will be reflected light but to return to the promised
definition i say that this luminous reverberation is not produced
by those portions of a body which are turned towards darkened
objects such as shaded spots fields with grass of various height
woods whether green or bare in which though that side of each
branch which is turned towards the original light has a share of
that light nevertheless the shadows cast by each branch separately
are so numerous as well as those cast by one branch on the others
that finally so much shadow is the result that the light counts for
nothing hence objects of this kind cannot throw any reflected light
on opposite objects
reflection on water 206 207

perspective
the shadow or object mirrored in water in motion that is to say in
small wavelets will always be larger than the external object
producing it
207
it is impossible that an object mirrored on water should correspond
in form to the object mirrored since the centre of the eye is above
the surface of the water
this is made plain in the figure here given which demonstrates that
the eye sees the surface a b and cannot see it at l f and at
r t it sees the surface of the image at r t and does not see
it in the real object c d hence it is impossible to see it as
has been said above unless the eye itself is situated on the surface
of the water as is shown below 13

experiments with the mirror 208210
208
the mirror
if the illuminated object is of the same size as the luminous body
and as that in which the light is reflected the amount of the
reflected light will bear the same proportion to the intermediate
light as this second light will bear to the first if both bodies
are smooth and white
209
describe how it is that no object has its limitation in the mirror
but in the eye which sees it in the mirror for if you look at your
face in the mirror the part resembles the whole in as much as the
part is everywhere in the mirror and the whole is in every part of
the same mirror and the same is true of the whole image of any
object placed opposite to this mirror c
210
no man can see the image of another man in a mirror in its proper
place with regard to the objects because every object falls on the
surface of the mirror at equal angles and if the one man who sees
the other in the mirror is not in a direct line with the image he
will not see it in the place where it really falls and if he gets
into the line he covers the other man and puts himself in the place
occupied by his image let n o be the mirror b the eye of your
friend and d your own eye your friends eye will appear to you at
a and to him it will seem that yours is at c and the
intersection of the visual rays will occur at m so that either of
you touching m will touch the eye of the other man which shall be
open and if you touch the eye of the other man in the mirror it
will seem to him that you are touching your own
appendixon shadows in movement 211 212
211
of the shadow and its motion
when two bodies casting shadows and one in front of the other are
between a window and the wall with some space between them the
shadow of the body which is nearest to the plane of the wall will
move if the body nearest to the window is put in transverse motion
across the window to prove this let a and b be two bodies
placed between the window n m and the plane surface o p with
sufficient space between them as shown by the space a b i say
that if the body a is moved towards s the shadow of the body b
which is at c will move towards d
212
of the motion of shadows
the motion of a shadow is always more rapid than that of the body
which produces it if the light is stationary to prove this let a
be the luminous body and b the body casting the shadow and d
the shadow then i say that in the time while the solid body moves
from b to c the shadow d will move to e and this
proportion in the rapidity of the movements made in the same space
of time is equal to that in the length of the space moved over
thus given the proportion of the space moved over by the body b
to c to that moved over by the shadow d to e the proportion
in the rapidity of their movements will be the same
but if the luminous body is also in movement with a velocity equal
to that of the solid body then the shadow and the body that casts
it will move with equal speed and if the luminous body moves more
rapidly than the solid body the motion of the shadow will be slower
than that of the body casting it
but if the luminous body moves more slowly than the solid body then
the shadow will move more rapidly than that body

footnote in this and the following chapters of ms c the order of
the original paging has been adhered to and is shown in
parenthesis leonardo himself has but rarely worked out the subject
of these propositions the space left for the purpose has
occasionally been made use of for quite different matter even the
numerous diagrams most of them very delicately sketched lettered
and numbered which occur on these pages are hardly ever explained
with the exception of those few which are here given
214
no small hole can so modify the convergence of rays of light as to
prevent at a long distance the transmission of the true form of
the luminous body causing them it is impossible that rays of light
passing through a parallel slit should not display the form of
the body causing them since all the effects produced by a luminous
body are in fact the reflection of that body the moon shaped
like a boat if transmitted through a hole is figured in the surface
it falls on as a boatshaped object footnote 8 in the ms a
blank space is left after this question why the eye sees bodies at
a distance larger than they measure on the vertical plane
footnote this chapter taken from another ms may as an
exception be placed here as it refers to the same subject as the
preceding section
on gradation of shadows 215 216
215
although the breadth and length of lights and shadow will be
narrower and shorter in foreshortening the quality and quantity of
the light and shade is not increased nor diminished
3the function of shade and light when diminished by
foreshortening will be to give shadow and to illuminate an object
opposite according to the quality and quantity in which they fall
on the body
5in proportion as a derived shadow is nearer to its penultimate
extremities the deeper it will appear g z beyond the intersection
faces only the part of the shadow marked y z this by
intersection takes the shadow from m n but by direct line it takes
the shadow a m hence it is twice as deep as g z y x by
intersection takes the shadow n o but by direct line the shadow
n m a therefore x y is three times as dark as z g x f by
intersection faces o b and by direct line o n m a therefore we
must say that the shadow between f x will be four times as dark as
the shadow z g because it faces four times as much shadow
let a b be the side where the primary shadow is and b c the
primary light d will be the spot where it is interceptedf g
the derived shadow and f e the derived light
and this must be at the beginning of the explanation

that part of the surface of a body on which the images reflection
from other bodies placed opposite fall at the largest angle will
assume their hue most strongly in the diagram below 8 is a larger
angle than 4 since its base a n is larger than e n the base of
4 this diagram below should end at a n 4 8 4that portion of
the illuminated surface on which a shadow is cast will be brightest
which lies contiguous to the cast shadow just as an object which is
lighted up by a greater quantity of luminous rays becomes brighter
so one on which a greater quantity of shadow falls will be darker
let 4 be the side of an illuminated surface 4 8 surrounding the
cast shadow g e 4 and this spot 4 will be lighter than 8 because
less shadow falls on it than on 8 since 4 faces only the shadow i
n and 8 faces and receives the shadow a e as well as i n which
makes it twice as dark and the same thing happens when you put the
atmosphere and the sun in the place of shade and light
12 the distribution of shadow originating in and limited by
plane surfaces placed near to each other equal in tone and directly
opposite will be darker at the ends than at the beginning which
will be determined by the incidence of the luminous rays you will
find the same proportion in the depth of the derived shadows a n
as in the nearness of the luminous bodies m b which cause them
and if the luminous bodies were of equal size you would still
farther find the same proportion in the light cast by the luminous
circles and their shadows as in the distance of the said luminous
bodies
footnote the diagram originally placed between lines 3 and 4 is on
pl vi no 3 in the diagram given above line 14 of the original
and here printed in the text the words corpo luminoso luminous
body are written in the circle m luminoso in the circle b
and ombroso body in shadow in the circle o
217
that part of the reflection will be brightest where the reflected
rays are shortest
2 the darkness occasioned by the casting of combined shadows will
be in conformity with its cause which will originate and terminate
between two plane surfaces near together alike in tone and directly
opposite each other
4 in proportion as the source of light is larger the luminous and
shadow rays will be more mixed together this result is produced
because wherever there is a larger quantity of luminous rays there
is most light but where there are fewer there is least light
consequently the shadow rays come in and mingle with them
footnote diagrams are inserted before lines 2 and 4
218
in all the proportions i lay down it must be understood that the
medium between the bodies is always the same 2 the smaller the
luminous body the more distinct will the transmission of the shadows
be
3 when of two opposite shadows produced by the same body one is
twice as dark as the other though similar in form one of the two
lights causing them must have twice the diameter that the other has
and be at twice the distance from the opaque body if the object is
lowly moved across the luminous body and the shadow is intercepted
at some distance from the object there will be the same relative
proportion between the motion of the derived shadow and the motion
of the primary shadow as between the distance from the object to
the light and that from the object to the spot where the shadow is
intercepted so that though the object is moved slowly the shadow
moves fast

a luminous body will appear less brilliant when surrounded by a
bright background
2 i have found that the stars which are nearest to the horizon
look larger than the others because light falls upon them from a
larger proportion of the solar body than when they are above us and
having more light from the sun they give more light and the bodies
which are most luminous appear the largest as may be seen by the
sun through a mist and overhead it appears larger where there is
no mist and diminished through mist no portion of the luminous body
is ever visible from any spot within the pyramid of pure derived
shadow
footnote between lines 1 and 2 there is in the original a large
diagram which does not refer to this text 
220
a body on which the solar rays fall between the thin branches of
trees far apart will cast but a single shadow
2 if an opaque body and a luminous one are both spherical the
base of the pyramid of rays will bear the same proportion to the
luminous body as the base of the pyramid of shade to the opaque
body
4 when the transmitted shadow is intercepted by a plane surface
placed opposite to it and farther away from the luminous body than
from the object which casts it it will appear proportionately
darker and the edges more distinct
footnote the diagram which in the original is placed above line
2 is similar to the one here given on page 73 section 120the
diagram here given in the margin stands in the original between
lines 3 and 4
221
a body illuminated by the solar rays passing between the thick
branches of trees will produce as many shadows as there are branches
between the sun and itself
where the shadowrays from an opaque pyramidal body are intercepted
they will cast a shadow of bifurcate outline and various depth at
the points a light which is broader than the apex but narrower than
the base of an opaque pyramidal body placed in front of it will
cause that pyramid to cast a shadow of bifurcate form and various
degrees of depth
if an opaque body smaller than the light casts two shadows and if
it is the same size or larger casts but one it follows that a
pyramidal body of which part is smaller part equal to and part
larger than the luminous body will cast a bifurcate shadow

perspective of disappearance
the theory of the prospettiva de perdimenti would in many
important details be quite unintelligible if it had not been led up
by the principles of light and shade on which it is based the word
prospettiva in the language of the time included the principles
of optics what leonardo understood by perdimenti will be
clearly seen in the early chapters nos 222224 it is in the
very nature of the case that the farther explanations given in the
subsequent chapters must be limited to general rules the sections
given as 227231 on indistinctness at short distances have it
is true only an indirect bearing on the subject but on the other
hand the following chapters 232234 on indistinctness at
great distances go fully into the matter and in chapters
235239 which treat of the importance of light and shade in the
perspective of disappearance the practical issues are distinctly
insisted on in their relation to the theory this is naturally
followed by the statements as to the effect of light or dark
backgrounds on the apparent size of bodies nos 240250 at
the end i have placed in the order of the original those sections
from the ms c which treat of the perspective of disappearance
and serve to some extent to complete the treatment of the subject
251262
definition 222 223
222
of the diminished distinctness of the outlines of opaque bodies
if the real outlines of opaque bodies are indistinguishable at even
a very short distance they will be more so at long distances and
since it is by its outlines that we are able to know the real form
of any opaque body when by its remoteness we fail to discern it as
a whole much more must we fail to discern its parts and outlines
223
of the diminution in perspective of opaque objects
among opaque objects of equal size the apparent diminution of size
will be in proportion to their distance from the eye of the
spectator but it is an inverse proportion since where the
distance is greater the opaque body will appear smaller and the
less the distance the larger will the object appear and this is the
fundamental principle of linear perspective and it
follows11every object as it becomes more remote loses first
those parts which are smallest thus of a horse we should lose the
legs before the head because the legs are thinner than the head
and the neck before the body for the same reason hence it follows
that the last part of the horse which would be discernible by the
eye would be the mass of the body in an oval form or rather in a
cylindrical form and this would lose its apparent thickness before
its lengthaccording to the 2nd rule given above c footnote 23
compare line 11
if the eye remains stationary the perspective terminates in the
distance in a point but if the eye moves in a straight horizontal
line the perspective terminates in a line and the reason is that
this line is generated by the motion of the point and our sight
therefore it follows that as we move our sight eye the point
moves and as we move the point the line is generated c
an illustration by experiment
224
every visible body in so far as it affects the eye includes three
attributes that is to say mass form and colour and the mass is
recognisable at a greater distance from the place of its actual
existence than either colour or form again colour is discernible
at a greater distance than form but this law does not apply to
luminous bodies
the above proposition is plainly shown and proved by experiment
because if you see a man close to you you discern the exact
appearance of the mass and of the form and also of the colouring if
he goes to some distance you will not recognise who he is because
the character of the details will disappear if he goes still
farther you will not be able to distinguish his colouring but he
will appear as a dark object and still farther he will appear as a
very small dark rounded object it appears rounded because distance
so greatly diminishes the various details that nothing remains
visible but the larger mass and the reason is this we know very
well that all the images of objects reach the senses by a small
aperture in the eye hence if the whole horizon a d is admitted
through such an aperture the object b c being but a very small
fraction of this horizon what space can it fill in that minute image
of so vast a hemisphere and because luminous bodies have more power
in darkness than any others it is evident that as the chamber of
the eye is very dark as is the nature of all colored cavities the
images of distant objects are confused and lost in the great light
of the sky and if they are visible at all appear dark and black
as every small body must when seen in the diffused light of the
atmosphere
footnote the diagram belonging to this passage is placed between
lines 5 and 6 it is no 4 on pl vi 
a guiding rule
225
of the atmosphere that interposes between the eye and visible
objects
an object will appear more or less distinct at the same distance in
proportion as the atmosphere existing between the eye and that
object is more or less clear hence as i know that the greater or
less quantity of the air that lies between the eye and the object
makes the outlines of that object more or less indistinct you must
diminish the definiteness of outline of those objects in proportion
to their increasing distance from the eye of the spectator
an experiment
226
when i was once in a place on the sea at an equal distance from the
shore and the mountains the distance from the shore looked much
greater than that from the mountains
on indistinctness at short distances 227231
227
if you place an opaque object in front of your eye at a distance of
four fingers breadth if it is smaller than the space between the
two eyes it will not interfere with your seeing any thing that may
be beyond it no object situated beyond another object seen by the
eye can be concealed by this nearer object if it is smaller than
the space from eye to eye
228
the eye cannot take in a luminous angle which is too close to it
229
that part of a surface will be better lighted on which the light
falls at the greater angle and that part on which the shadow falls
at the greatest angle will receive from those rays least of the
benefit of the light
230
of the eye
the edges of an object placed in front of the pupil of the eye will
be less distinct in proportion as they are closer to the eye this
is shown by the edge of the object n placed in front of the pupil
d in looking at this edge the pupil also sees all the space a c
which is beyond the edge and the images the eye receives from that
space are mingled with the images of the edge so that one image
confuses the other and this confusion hinders the pupil from
distinguishing the edge
231
the outlines of objects will be least clear when they are nearest to
the eye and therefore remoter outlines will be clearer among
objects which are smaller than the pupil of the eye those will be
less distinct which are nearer to the eye
on indistinctness at great distances 232234
232
objects near to the eye will appear larger than those at a distance
objects seen with two eyes will appear rounder than if they are seen
with only one
objects seen between light and shadow will show the most relief
233
of painting
our true perception of an object diminishes in proportion as its
size is diminished by distance
234
perspective
why objects seen at a distance appear large to the eye and in the
image on the vertical plane they appear small
perspective
i ask how far away the eye can discern a nonluminous body as for
instance a mountain it will be very plainly visible if the sun is
behind it and could be seen at a greater or less distance according
to the suns place in the sky
footnote the clue to the solution of this problem lines 13 is
given in lines 46 no 232 objects seen with both eyes appear
solid since they are seen from two distinct points of sight
separated by the distance between the eyes but this solidity cannot
be represented in a flat drawing compare no 535
the importance of light and shade in the perspective of
disappearance 235239
235
an opaque body seen in a line in which the light falls will reveal
no prominences to the eye for instance let a be the solid body
and c the light c m and c n will be the lines of incidence of
the light that is to say the lines which transmit the light to the
object a the eye being at the point b i say that since the
light c falls on the whole part m n the portions in relief on
that side will all be illuminated hence the eye placed at c
cannot see any light and shade and not seeing it every portion
will appear of the same tone therefore the relief in the prominent
or rounded parts will not be visible
236
of painting
when you represent in your work shadows which you can only discern
with difficulty and of which you cannot distinguish the edges so
that you apprehend them confusedly you must not make them sharp or
definite lest your work should have a wooden effect
237
of painting
you will observe in drawing that among the shadows some are of
undistinguishable gradation and form as is shown in the 3rd
proposition which says rounded surfaces display as many degrees
of light and shade as there are varieties of brightness and darkness
reflected from the surrounding objects
238
of light and shade
you who draw from nature look carefully at the extent the
degree and the form of the lights and shadows on each muscle and
in their position lengthwise observe towards which muscle the axis
of the central line is directed
239
an object which is so brilliantly illuminated as to be almost as
bright as light will be visible at a greater distance and of larger
apparent size than is natural to objects so remote
the effect of light or dark backgrounds on the apparent size of
objects 240250
240
a shadow will appear dark in proportion to the brilliancy of the
light surrounding it and conversely it will be less conspicuous
where it is seen against a darker background
241
of ordinary perspective
an object of equal breadth and colour throughout seen against a
background of various colours will appear unequal in breadth
and if an object of equal breadth throughout but of various
colours is seen against a background of uniform colour that object
will appear of various breadth and the more the colours of the
background or of the object seen against the ground vary the
greater will the apparent variations in the breadth be though the
objects seen against the ground be of equal breadth throughout
242
a dark object seen against a bright background will appear smaller
than it is
a light object will look larger when it is seen against a background
darker than itself
243
of light
a luminous body when obscured by a dense atmosphere will appear
smaller as may be seen by the moon or sun veiled by mists
of light
of several luminous bodies of equal size and brilliancy and at an
equal distance that will look the largest which is surrounded by
the darkest background
of light
i find that any luminous body when seen through a dense and thick
mist diminishes in proportion to its distance from the eye thus it
is with the sun by day as well as the moon and the other eternal
lights by night and when the air is clear these luminaries appear
larger in proportion as they are farther from the eye
244
that portion of a body of uniform breadth which is against a lighter
background will look narrower than the rest
4 e is a given object itself dark and of uniform breadth a b
and c d are two backgrounds one darker than the other b c is a
bright background as it might be a spot lighted by the sun through
an aperture in a dark room then i say that the object e g will
appear larger at e f than at g h because e f has a darker
background than g h and again at f g it will look narrower from
being seen by the eye o on the light background b c footnote
12 the diagram to which the text lines 111 refers is placed in
the original between lines 3 and 4 and is given on pl xli no 3
lines 12 to 14 are explained by the lower of the two diagrams on pl
xli no 4 in the original these are placed after line 14 that
part of a luminous body of equal breadth and brilliancy throughout
will look largest which is seen against the darkest background and
the luminous body will seem on fire
245
why bodies in light and shade have their outlines altered by the
colour and brightness of the objects serving as a background to
them
if you look at a body of which the illuminated portion lies and ends
against a dark background that part of the light which will look
brightest will be that which lies against the dark background at
d but if this brighter part lies against a light background the
edge of the object which is itself light will be less distinct
than before and the highest light will appear to be between the
limit of the background m f and the shadow the same thing is seen
with regard to the dark side inasmuch as that edge of the shaded
portion of the object which lies against a light background as at
l it looks much darker than the rest but if this shadow lies
against a dark background the edge of the shaded part will appear
lighter than before and the deepest shade will appear between the
edge and the light at the point o
footnote in the original diagram o is inside the shaded surface
at the level of d
246
an opaque body will appear smaller when it is surrounded by a highly
luminous background and a light body will appear larger when it is
seen against a darker background this may be seen in the height of
buildings at night when lightning flashes behind them it suddenly
seems when it lightens as though the height of the building were
diminished for the same reason such buildings look larger in a
mist or by night than when the atmosphere is clear and light
247
on light between shadows
when you are drawing any object remember in comparing the grades
of light in the illuminated portions that the eye is often deceived
by seeing things lighter than they are and the reason lies in our
comparing those parts with the contiguous parts since if two
separate parts are in different grades of light and if the less
bright is conterminous with a dark portion and the brighter is
conterminous with a light backgroundas the sky or something
equally bright then that which is less light or i should say
less radiant will look the brighter and the brighter will seem the
darker
248
of objects equally dark in themselves and situated at a considerable
and equal distance that will look the darkest which is farthest
above the earth
249
to prove how it is that luminous bodies appear larger at a
distance than they are
if you place two lighted candles side by side half a braccio apart
and go from them to a distance 200 braccia you will see that by the
increased size of each they will appear as a single luminous body
with the light of the two flames one braccio wide
to prove how you may see the real size of luminous bodies
if you wish to see the real size of these luminous bodies take a
very thin board and make in it a hole no bigger than the tag of a
lace and place it as close to your eye as possible so that when you
look through this hole at the said light you can see a large space
of air round it then by rapidly moving this board backwards and
forwards before your eye you will see the light increase and
diminish

of several bodies of equal size and equally distant from the eye
those will look the smallest which are against the lightest

highly lighted than the other
251
perspective
no visible object can be well understood and comprehended by the
human eye excepting from the difference of the background against
which the edges of the object terminate and by which they are
bounded and no object will appear to stand out separate from that
background so far as the outlines of its borders are concerned the
moon though it is at a great distance from the sun when in an
eclipse it comes between our eyes and the sun appears to the eyes
of men to be close to the sun and affixed to it because the sun is
then the background to the moon

a luminous body will appear more brilliant in proportion as it is
surrounded by deeper shadow footnote the diagram which in the

260
different portions of a wall surface will be darker or brighter in
proportion as the light or shadow falls on them at a larger angle
the foregoing proposition can be clearly proved in this way let us
say that m q is the luminous body then f g will be the opaque
body and let a e be the abovementioned plane on which the said
angles fall showing plainly the nature and character of their
bases then a will be more luminous than b the base of the
angle a is larger than that of b and it therefore makes a
greater angle which will be a m q and the pyramid b p m will be
narrower and m o c will be still finer and so on by degrees in
proportion as they are nearer to e the pyramids will become
narrower and darker that portion of the wall will be the darkest
where the breadth of the pyramid of shadow is greater than the
breadth of the pyramid of light
at the point a the pyramid of light is equal in strength to the
pyramid of shadow because the base f g is equal to the base r
f at the point d the pyramid of light is narrower than the
pyramid of shadow by so much as the base s f is less than the base
f g
divide the foregoing proposition into two diagrams one with the
pyramids of light and shadow the other with the pyramids of light

261
among shadows of equal depth those which are nearest to the eye will
look least deep
262
the more brilliant the light given by a luminous body the deeper
will the shadows be cast by the objects it illuminates

theory of colours
leonardos theory of colours is even more intimately connected with
his principles of light and shade than his perspective of
disappearance and is in fact merely an appendix or supplement to
those principles as we gather from the titles to sections 264
267 and 276 while others again nos 281 282 are headed
prospettiva
a very few of these chapters are to be found in the oldest copies
and editions of the treatise on painting and although the material
they afford is but meager and the connection between them but
slight we must still attribute to them a special theoretical value
as well as practical utilityall the more so because our knowledge
of the theory and use of colours at the time of the renaissance is
still extremely limited
the reciprocal effects of colours on objects placed opposite each
other 263272
263
of painting
the hue of an illuminated object is affected by that of the luminous
body
264
of shadow
the surface of any opaque body is affected by the colour of
surrounding objects
265
a shadow is always affected by the colour of the surface on which it
is cast
266
an image produced in a mirror is affected by the colour of the
mirror
267
of light and shade
every portion of the surface of a body is varied in hue by the
reflected colour of the object that may be opposite to it
example
if you place a spherical body between various objects that is to say
with direct sunlight on one side of it and on the other a wall
illuminated by the sun which wall may be green or of any other
colour while the surface on which it is placed may be red and the
two lateral sides are in shadow you will see that the natural
colour of that body will assume something of the hue reflected from
those objects the strongest will be given by the luminous body
the second by the illuminated wall the third by the shadows there
will still be a portion which will take a tint from the colour of
the edges
268
the surface of every opaque body is affected by the colour of the
objects surrounding it but this effect will be strong or weak in
proportion as those objects are more or less remote and more or less
strongly coloured
269
of painting
the surface of every opaque body assumes the hues reflected from
surrounding objects
the surface of an opaque body assumes the hues of surrounding
objects more strongly in proportion as the rays that form the images
of those objects strike the surface at more equal angles
and the surface of an opaque body assumes a stronger hue from the
surrounding objects in proportion as that surface is whiter and the
colour of the object brighter or more highly illuminated
270
of the rays which convey through the air the images of objects
all the minutest parts of the image intersect each other without
interfering with each other to prove this let r be one of the
sides of the hole opposite to which let s be the eye which sees
the lower end o of the line n o the other extremity cannot
transmit its image to the eye s as it has to strike the end r
and it is the same with regard to m at the middle of the line the
case is the same with the upper extremity n and the eye u and
if the end n is red the eye u on that side of the holes will not
see the green colour of o but only the red of n according to
the 7th of this where it is said every form projects images from
itself by the shortest line which necessarily is a straight line
c
footnote 13 this probably refers to the diagram given under no

271
of painting
the surface of a body assumes in some degree the hue of those around
it the colours of illuminated objects are reflected from the
surfaces of one to the other in various spots according to the
various positions of those objects let o be a blue object in full
light facing all by itself the space b c on the white sphere a b
e d e f and it will give it a blue tinge m is a yellow body
reflected onto the space a b at the same time as o the blue
body and they give it a green colour by the 2nd proposition of
this which shows that blue and yellow make a beautiful green c
and the rest will be set forth in the book on painting in that book
it will be shown that by transmitting the images of objects and
the colours of bodies illuminated by sunlight through a small round
perforation and into a dark chamber onto a plane surface which
itself is quite white c
but every thing will be upside down
combination of different colours in cast shadows
272
that which casts the shadow does not face it because the shadows
are produced by the light which causes and surrounds the shadows
the shadow caused by the light e which is yellow has a blue
tinge because the shadow of the body a is cast upon the pavement
at b where the blue light falls and the shadow produced by the
light d which is blue will be yellow at c because the yellow
light falls there and the surrounding background to these shadows b
c will besides its natural colour assume a hue compounded of
yellow and blue because it is lighted by the yellow light and by
the blue light both at once
shadows of various colours as affected by the lights falling on
them that light which causes the shadow does not face it
footnote in the original diagram we find in the circle e
giallo yellow and the cirle d azurro blue and also
under the circle of shadow to the left giallo is written and
under that to the right azurro
in the second diagram where four circles are placed in a row we find
written beginning at the left hand giallo yellow azurro
blue verde green rosso red
the effect of colours in the camera obscura 273274
273
the edges of a coloured object transmitted through a small hole
are more conspicuous than the central portions
the edges of the images of whatever colour which are transmitted
through a small aperture into a dark chamber will always be stronger
than the middle portions
274
of the intersections of the images in the pupil of the eye
the intersections of the images as they enter the pupil do not
mingle in confusion in the space where that intersection unites
them as is evident since if the rays of the sun pass through two
panes of glass in close contact of which one is blue and the other
yellow the rays in penetrating them do not become blue or yellow
but a beautiful green and the same thing would happen in the eye
if the images which were yellow or green should mingle where they
meet and intersect as they enter the pupil as this does not
happen such a mingling does not exist
of the nature of the rays composed of the images of objects and of
their intersections
the directness of the rays which transmit the forms and colours of
the bodies whence they proceed does not tinge the air nor can they
affect each other by contact where they intersect they affect only
the spot where they vanish and cease to exist because that spot
faces and is faced by the original source of these rays and no
other object which surrounds that original source can be seen by
the eye where these rays are cut off and destroyed leaving there
the spoil they have conveyed to it and this is proved by the 4th
proposition on the colour of bodies which says the surface of
every opaque body is affected by the colour of surrounding objects
hence we may conclude that the spot which by means of the rays
which convey the image facesand is faced by the cause of the
image assumes the colour of that object
on the colours of derived shadows 275 276
275
any shadow cast by an opaque body smaller than the light causing the
shadow will throw a derived shadow which is tinged by the colour of
the light
let n be the source of the shadow e f it will assume its hue
let o be the source of h e which will in the same way be tinged
by its hue and so also the colour of v h will be affected by p
which causes it and the shadow of the triangle z k y will be
affected by the colour of q because it is produced by it 7 in
proportion as c d goes into a d will n r s be darker than
m and the rest of the space will be shadowless 11 f g is
the highest light because here the whole light of the window a d
falls and thus on the opaque body m e is in equally high light
z k y is a triangle which includes the deepest shadow because the
light a d cannot reach any part of it x h is the 2nd grade of
shadow because it receives only 13 of the light from the window
that is c d the third grade of shadow is h e where two thirds
of the light from the window is visible the last grade of shadow is
b d e f because the highest grade of light from the window falls
at f
footnote the diagram pl iii no 1 belongs to this chapter as
well as the text given in no 148 lines 711 compare lines 812 of
no 148 which are written within the diagram evidently apply to
both sections and have therefore been inserted in both
276
of the colours of simple derived shadows
the colour of derived shadows is always affected by that of the body
towards which they are cast to prove this let an opaque body be
placed between the plane s c t d and the blue light d e and the
red light a b then i say that d e the blue light will fall on
the whole surface s c t d excepting at o p which is covered by
the shadow of the body q r as is shown by the straight lines d q
o e r p and the same occurs with the light a b which falls on
the whole surface s c t d excepting at the spot obscured by the
shadow q r as is shown by the lines d q o and e r p hence
we may conclude that the shadow n m is exposed to the blue light
d e but as the red light a b cannot fall there n m will
appear as a blue shadow on a red background tinted with blue
because on the surface s c t d both lights can fall but in the
shadows only one single light falls for this reason these shadows
are of medium depth since if no light whatever mingled with the
shadow it would be of the first degree of darkness c but in the
shadow at o p the blue light does not fall because the body q r
interposes and intercepts it there only the red light a b falls
there and tinges the shadow of a red hue and so a ruddy shadow
appears on the background of mingled red and blue
the shadow of q r at o p is red being caused by the blue light
d e and the shadow of q r at o p is blue being caused by
the red light a b hence we say that the blue light in this
instance causes a red derived shadow from the opaque body q r
while the red light causes the same body to cast a blue derived
shadow but the primary shadow on the dark side of the body itself
is not of either of those hues but a mixture of red and blue
the derived shadows will be equal in depth if they are produced by
lights of equal strength and at an equal distance this is proved

seen in the open air and high up all its shadows are bluish and
this is caused according to the 4th prop which says the
surface of every opaque body assumes the hue of the surrounding
objects now this white body being deprived of the light of the
sun by the interposition of some body between the sun and itself
all that portion of it which is exposed to the sun and atmosphere
assumes the colour of the sun and atmosphere the side on which the
sun does not fall remains in shadow and assumes the hue of the
atmosphere and if this white object did not reflect the green of
the fields all the way to the horizon nor get the brightness of the
horizon itself it would certainly appear simply of the same hue as
the atmosphere

perspective
every object devoid of colour in itself is more or less tinged by
the colour of the object placed opposite this may be seen by
experience inasmuch as any object which mirrors another assumes the
colour of the object mirrored in it and if the surface thus
partially coloured is white the portion which has a red reflection
will appear red or any other colour whether bright or dark

what portion of a coloured surface ought in reason to be the most
intense
if a is the light and b illuminated by it in a direct line
c on which the light cannot fall is lighted only by reflection
from b which let us say is red hence the light reflected from
it will be affected by the hue of the surface causing it and will
tinge the surface c with red and if c is also red you will see
it much more intense than b and if it were yellow you would see
there a colour between yellow and red
on the use of dark and light colours in painting 284286
284
why beautiful colours must be in the highest light
since we see that the quality of colour is known only by means of
light it is to be supposed that where there is most light the true
character of a colour in light will be best seen and where there is
most shadow the colour will be affected by the tone of that hence
o painter remember to show the true quality of colours in bright
lights
285
an object represented in white and black will display stronger
relief than in any other way hence i would remind you o painter to
dress your figures in the lightest colours you can since if you
put them in dark colours they will be in too slight relief and
inconspicuous from a distance and the reason is that the shadows of
all objects are dark and if you make a dress dark there is little
variety in the lights and shadows while in light colours there are
many grades
286
of painting
colours seen in shadow will display more or less of their natural
brilliancy in proportion as they are in fainter or deeper shadow
but if these same colours are situated in a welllighted place they
will appear brighter in proportion as the light is more brilliant
the adversary
the variety of colours in shadow must be as great as that of the
colours in the objects in that shadow
the answer
colours seen in shadow will display less variety in proportion as
the shadows in which they lie are deeper and evidence of this is to
be had by looking from an open space into the doorways of dark and
shadowy churches where the pictures which are painted in various
colours all look of uniform darkness
hence at a considerable distance all the shadows of different
colours will appear of the same darkness
it is the light side of an object in light and shade which shows the
true colour
on the colours of the rainbow 287 288
287
treat of the rainbow in the last book on painting but first write
the book on colours produced by the mixture of other colours so as
to be able to prove by those painters colours how the colours of
the rainbow are produced
288
whether the colours of the rainbow are produced by the sun
the colours of the rainbow are not produced by the sun for they
occur in many ways without the sunshine as may be seen by holding a
glass of water up to the eye when in the glasswhere there are
those minute bubbles always seen in coarse glasseach bubble even
though the sun does not fall on it will produce on one side all the
colours of the rainbow as you may see by placing the glass between
the day light and your eye in such a way as that it is close to the
eye while on one side the glass admits the diffused light of the
atmosphere and on the other side the shadow of the wall on one side
of the window either left or right it matters not which then by
turning the glass round you will see these colours all round the
bubbles in the glass c and the rest shall be said in its place
that the eye has no part in producing the colours of the rainbow
in the experiment just described the eye would seem to have some
share in the colours of the rainbow since these bubbles in the
glass do not display the colours except through the medium of the
eye but if you place the glass full of water on the window sill
in such a position as that the outer side is exposed to the suns
rays you will see the same colours produced in the spot of light
thrown through the glass and upon the floor in a dark place below
the window and as the eye is not here concerned in it we may
evidently and with certainty pronounce that the eye has no share in
producing them
of the colours in the feathers of certain birds
there are many birds in various regions of the world on whose
feathers we see the most splendid colours produced as they move as
we see in our own country in the feathers of peacocks or on the
necks of ducks or pigeons c
again on the surface of antique glass found underground and on the
roots of turnips kept for some time at the bottom of wells or other
stagnant waters we see that each root displays colours similar to
those of the real rainbow they may also be seen when oil has been
placed on the top of water and in the solar rays reflected from the
surface of a diamond or beryl again through the angular facet of a
beryl every dark object against a background of the atmosphere or
any thing else equally palecoloured is surrounded by these rainbow
colours between the atmosphere and the dark body and in many other
circumstances which i will not mention as these suffice for my
purpose

prospettiva de colri perspective of colour
and
prospettiva aerea aerial perspective
leonardo distinctly separates these branches of his subject as may
be seen in the beginning of no 295 attempts have been made to
cast doubts on the results which leonardo arrived at by experiment
on the perspective of colour but not with justice as may be seen
from the original text of section 294
the question as to the composition of the atmosphere which is
inseparable from a discussion on aerial perspective forms a
separate theory which is treated at considerable length indeed the
author enters into it so fully that we cannot escape the conviction
that he must have dwelt with particular pleasure on this part of his
subject and that he attached great importance to giving it a
character of general applicability
general rules 289291
289
the variety of colour in objects cannot be discerned at a great
distance excepting in those parts which are directly lighted up by
the solar rays
290
as to the colours of objects at long distances no difference is
perceptible in the parts in shadow
291
of the visibility of colours
which colour strikes most an object at a distance is most
conspicuous when it is lightest and the darkest is least visible
an exceptional case
292
of the edges outlines of shadows some have misty and ill defined
edges others distinct ones
no opaque body can be devoid of light and shade except it is in a
mist on ground covered with snow or when snow is falling on the
open country which has no light on it and is surrounded with
darkness
and this occurs only in spherical bodies because in other bodies
which have limbs and parts those sides of limbs which face each
other reflect on each other the accidental hue and tone of their
surface
an experiment
293
all colours are at a distance undistinguishable and undiscernible
all colours at a distance are undistinguishable in shadow because
an object which is not in the highest light is incapable of
transmitting its image to the eye through an atmosphere more
luminous than itself since the lesser brightness must be absorbed
by the greater for instance we in a house can see that all the
colours on the surface of the walls are clearly and instantly
visible when the windows of the house are open but if we were to go
out of the house and look in at the windows from a little distance
to see the paintings on those walls instead of the paintings we
should see an uniform deep and colourless shadow
the practice of the prospettiva de colori
294
how a painter should carry out the perspective of colour in
practice
in order to put into practice this perspective of the variation and
loss or diminution of the essential character of colours observe at
every hundred braccia some objects standing in the landscape such
as trees houses men and particular places then in front of the
first tree have a very steady plate of glass and keep your eye very
steady and then on this plate of glass draw a tree tracing it
over the form of that tree then move it on one side so far as that
the real tree is close by the side of the tree you have drawn then
colour your drawing in such a way as that in colour and form the two
may be alike and that both if you close one eye seem to be
painted on the glass and at the same distance then by the same
method represent a second tree and a third with a distance of a
hundred braccia between each and these will serve as a standard and
guide whenever you work on your own pictures wherever they may
apply and will enable you to give due distance in those works 14
but i have found that as a rule the second is 45 of the first when
it is 20 braccia beyond it
footnote this chapter is one of those copied in the manuscript of
the vatican library urbinas 1270 and the original text is rendered
here with no other alterations but in the orthography h ludwig
in his edition of this copy translates lines 14 and 15 thus ich
finde aber als regel dass der zweite um vier funftel des ersten
abnimmt wenn er namlich zwanzig ellen vom ersten entfernt ist
 he adds in his commentary das ende der nummer ist wohl
jedenfalls verstummelt however the translation given above shows
that it admits of a different rendering
the rules of aerial perspective 295297
295
of aerial perspective
there is another kind of perspective which i call aerial
perspective because by the atmosphere we are able to distinguish
the variations in distance of different buildings which appear
placed on a single line as for instance when we see several
buildings beyond a wall all of which as they appear above the top
of the wall look of the same size while you wish to represent them
in a picture as more remote one than another and to give the effect
of a somewhat dense atmosphere you know that in an atmosphere of
equal density the remotest objects seen through it as mountains in
consequence of the great quantity of atmosphere between your eye and
themappear blue and almost of the same hue as the atmosphere
itself footnote 10 quado il sole e per leuante when the sun is
in the east apparently the author refers here to morning light in
general h ludwig however translates this passage from the vatican
copy wenn namlich die sonne dahinter im osten steht when the
sun is in the east footnote 11 see footnote 10 hence you must
make the nearest building above the wall of its real colour but the
more distant ones make less defined and bluer those you wish should
look farthest away you must make proportionately bluer thus if one
is to be five times as distant make it five times bluer and by
this rule the buildings which above a given line appear of the
same size will plainly be distinguished as to which are the more
remote and which larger than the others
296
the medium lying between the eye and the object seen tinges that
object with its colour as the blueness of the atmosphere makes the
distant mountains appear blue and red glass makes objects seen
beyond it look red the light shed round them by the stars is
obscured by the darkness of the night which lies between the eye and
the radiant light of the stars
297
take care that the perspective of colour does not disagree with the
size of your objects hat is to say that the colours diminish from
their natural vividness in proportion as the objects at various
distances dimmish from their natural size
on the relative density of the atmosphere 298290
298
why the atmosphere must be represented as paler towards the lower
portion
because the atmosphere is dense near the earth and the higher it is
the rarer it becomes when the sun is in the east if you look
towards the west and a little way to the south and north you will
see that this dense atmosphere receives more light from the sun than
the rarer because the rays meet with greater resistance and if the
sky as you see it ends on a low plain that lowest portion of the
sky will be seen through a denser and whiter atmosphere which will
weaken its true colour as seen through that medium and there the
sky will look whiter than it is above you where the line of sight
travels through a smaller space of air charged with heavy vapour
and if you turn to the east the atmosphere will appear darker as
you look lower down because the luminous rays pass less freely
through the lower atmosphere
299
of the mode of treating remote objects in painting
it is easy to perceive that the atmosphere which lies closest to the
level ground is denser than the rest and that where it is higher
up it is rarer and more transparent the lower portions of large
and lofty objects which are at a distance are not much seen because
you see them along a line which passes through a denser and thicker
section of the atmosphere the summits of such heights are seen
along a line which though it starts from your eye in a dense
atmosphere still as it ends at the top of those lofty objects
ceases in a much rarer atmosphere than exists at their base for
this reason the farther this line extends from your eye from point
to point the atmosphere becomes more and more rare hence o
painter when you represent mountains see that from hill to hill
the bases are paler than the summits and in proportion as they
recede beyond each other make the bases paler than the summits
while the higher they are the more you must show of their true form
and colour
on the colour of the atmosphere 300307
300
of the colour of the atmosphere
i say that the blueness we see in the atmosphere is not intrinsic
colour but is caused by warm vapour evaporated in minute and
insensible atoms on which the solar rays fall rendering them
luminous against the infinite darkness of the fiery sphere which
lies beyond and includes it and this may be seen as i saw it by
any one going up footnote 5 with regard to the place spoken of as
moboso compare no 301 line 20 its identity will be discussed
under leonardos topographical notes in vol ii monboso a peak of
the alps which divide france from italy the base of this mountain
gives birth to the four rivers which flow in four different
directions through the whole of europe and no mountain has its base
at so great a height as this which lifts itself almost above the
clouds and snow seldom falls there but only hail in the summer
when the clouds are highest and this hail lies unmelted there so
that if it were not for the absorption of the rising and falling
clouds which does not happen twice in an age an enormous mass of
ice would be piled up there by the hail and in the middle of july i
found it very considerable there i saw above me the dark sky and
the sun as it fell on the mountain was far brighter here than in the
plains below because a smaller extent of atmosphere lay between the
summit of the mountain and the sun again as an illustration of the
colour of the atmosphere i will mention the smoke of old and dry
wood which as it comes out of a chimney appears to turn very
blue when seen between the eye and the dark distance but as it
rises and comes between the eye and the bright atmosphere it at
once shows of an ashy grey colour and this happens because it no
longer has darkness beyond it but this bright and luminous space
if the smoke is from young green wood it will not appear blue
because not being transparent and being full of superabundant
moisture it has the effect of condensed clouds which take distinct
lights and shadows like a solid body the same occurs with the
atmosphere which when overcharged with moisture appears white and
the small amount of heated moisture makes it dark of a dark blue
colour and this will suffice us so far as concerns the colour of
the atmosphere though it might be added that if this transparent
blue were the natural colour of the atmosphere it would follow that
wherever a larger mass air intervened between the eye and the
element of fire the azure colour would be more intense as we see
in blue glass and in sapphires which are darker in proportion as
they are larger but the atmosphere in such circumstances behaves in
an opposite manner inasmuch as where a greater quantity of it lies
between the eye and the sphere of fire it is seen much whiter this
occurs towards the horizon and the less the extent of atmosphere
between the eye and the sphere of fire the deeper is the blue
colour as may be seen even on low plains hence it follows as i
say that the atmosphere assumes this azure hue by reason of the
particles of moisture which catch the rays of the sun again we may
note the difference in particles of dust or particles of smoke in
the sun beams admitted through holes into a dark chamber when the
former will look ash grey and the thin smoke will appear of a most
beautiful blue and it may be seen again in in the dark shadows of
distant mountains when the air between the eye and those shadows
will look very blue though the brightest parts of those mountains
will not differ much from their true colour but if any one wishes
for a final proof let him paint a board with various colours among
them an intense black and over all let him lay a very thin and
transparent coating of white he will then see that this
transparent white will nowhere show a more beautiful blue than over
the blackbut it must be very thin and finely ground
footnote 7 reta here has the sense of malanno
301
experience shows us that the air must have darkness beyond it and
yet it appears blue if you produce a small quantity of smoke from
dry wood and the rays of the sun fall on this smoke and if you then
place behind the smoke a piece of black velvet on which the sun does
not shine you will see that all the smoke which is between the eye
and the black stuff will appear of a beautiful blue colour and if
instead of the velvet you place a white cloth smoke that is too
thick smoke hinders and too thin smoke does not produce the
perfection of this blue colour hence a moderate amount of smoke
produces the finest blue water violently ejected in a fine spray
and in a dark chamber where the sun beams are admitted produces
these blue rays and the more vividly if it is distilled water and
thin smoke looks blue this i mention in order to show that the
blueness of the atmosphere is caused by the darkness beyond it and
these instances are given for those who cannot confirm my experience
on monboso
302
when the smoke from dry wood is seen between the eye of the
spectator and some dark space or object it will look blue thus
the sky looks blue by reason of the darkness beyond it and if you
look towards the horizon of the sky you will see the atmosphere is
not blue and this is caused by its density and thus at each
degree as you raise your eyes above the horizon up to the sky over
your head you will see the atmosphere look darker blue and this
is because a smaller density of air lies between your eye and the
outer darkness and if you go to the top of a high mountain the
sky will look proportionately darker above you as the atmosphere
becomes rarer between you and the outer darkness and this will be
more visible at each degree of increasing height till at last we
should find darkness
that smoke will look bluest which rises from the driest wood and
which is nearest to the fire and is seen against the darkest
background and with the sunlight upon it
303
a dark object will appear bluest in proportion as it has a greater
mass of luminous atmosphere between it and the eye as may be seen
in the colour of the sky
304
the atmosphere is blue by reason of the darkness above it because
black and white make blue
305
in the morning the mist is denser above than below because the sun
draws it upwards hence tall buildings even if the summit is at the
same distance as the base have the summit invisible therefore
also the sky looks darkest in colour overhead and towards the
horizon it is not blue but rather between smoke and dust colour
the atmosphere when full of mist is quite devoid of blueness and
only appears of the colour of clouds which shine white when the
weather is fine and the more you turn to the west the darker it
will be and the brighter as you look to the east and the verdure
of the fields is bluish in a thin mist but grows grey in a dense
one
the buildings in the west will only show their illuminated side
where the sun shines and the mist hides the rest when the sun
rises and chases away the haze the hills on the side where it lifts
begin to grow clearer and look blue and seem to smoke with the
vanishing mists and the buildings reveal their lights and shadows
through the thinner vapour they show only their lights and through
the thicker air nothing at all this is when the movement of the
mist makes it part horizontally and then the edges of the mist will
be indistinct against the blue of the sky and towards the earth it
will look almost like dust blown up in proportion as the atmosphere
is dense the buildings of a city and the trees in a landscape will
look fewer because only the tallest and largest will be seen
darkness affects every thing with its hue and the more an object
differs from darkness the more we see its real and natural colour
the mountains will look few because only those will be seen which
are farthest apart since at such a distance the density increases
to such a degree that it causes a brightness by which the darkness
of the hills becomes divided and vanishes indeed towards the top
there is less mist between lower and nearer hills and yet little
is to be distinguished and least towards the bottom
306
the surface of an object partakes of the colour of the light which
illuminates it and of the colour of the atmosphere which lies
between the eye and that object that is of the colour of the
transparent medium lying between the object and the eye and among
colours of a similar character the second will be of the same tone
as the first and this is caused by the increased thickness of the
colour of the medium lying between the object and the eye
307 of painting
of various colours which are none of them blue that which at a great
distance will look bluest is the nearest to black and so
conversely the colour which is least like black will at a great
distance best preserve its own colour
hence the green of fields will assume a bluer hue than yellow or
white will and conversely yellow or white will change less than
green and red still less

on the proportions and on the movements of the human figure
leonardos researches on the proportions and movements of the human
figure must have been for the most part completed and written before
the year 1498 for luca paciolo writes in the dedication to
ludovico il moro of his book divina proportione which was
published in that year leonardo da venci  hauedo gia co tutta

the vatican copy includes but very few sections of the universale
misura del huomo and until now nothing has been made known of the
original mss on the subject which have supplied the very extensive
materials for this portion of the work the collection at windsor
belonging to her majesty the queen includes by far the most
important part of leonardos investigations on this subject
constituting about half of the whole of the materials here
published and the large number of original drawings adds greatly to
the interest which the subject itself must command luca paciolo
would seem to have had these mss which i have distinguished by the
initials w p in his mind when he wrote the passage quoted above
still certain notes of a later datesuch as nos 360 362 and 363
from ms e written in 151314 sufficiently prove that leonardo did
not consider his earlier studies on the proportions and movements of
the human figure final and complete as we might suppose from luca
paciolos statement or else he took the subject up again at a
subsequent period since his former researches had been carried on
at milan between 1490 and 1500 indeed it is highly probable that
the anatomical studies which he was pursuing zvith so much zeal
between 151016 should have led him to reconsider the subject of
proportion

vitruvius the architect says in his work on architecture that the
measurements of the human body are distributed by nature as follows
that is that 4 fingers make 1 palm and 4 palms make 1 foot 6 palms
make 1 cubit 4 cubits make a mans height and 4 cubits make one
pace and 24 palms make a man and these measures he used in his
buildings if you open your legs so much as to decrease your height
114 and spread and raise your arms till your middle fingers touch
the level of the top of your head you must know that the centre of
the outspread limbs will be in the navel and the space between the
legs will be an equilateral triangle
the length of a mans outspread arms is equal to his height
from the roots of the hair to the bottom of the chin is the tenth of
a mans height from the bottom of the chin to the top of his head
is one eighth of his height from the top of the breast to the top
of his head will be one sixth of a man from the top of the breast

of the motions of the fingers
the movements of the fingers principally consist in extending and
bending them this extension and bending vary in manner that is
sometimes they bend altogether at the first joint sometimes they
bend or extend half way at the 2nd joint and sometimes they bend
in their whole length and in all the three joints at once if the 2
first joints are hindered from bending then the 3rd joint can be
bent with greater ease than before it can never bend of itself if
the other joints are free unless all three joints are bent besides
all these movements there are 4 other principal motions of which 2
are up and down the two others from side to side and each of these
is effected by a single tendon from these there follow an infinite
number of other movements always effected by two tendons one tendon
ceasing to act the other takes up the movement the tendons are
made thick inside the fingers and thin outside and the tendons
inside are attached to every joint but outside they are not

just so much as the part d a of the nude figure decreases in this
position so much does the opposite part increase that is in
proportion as the length of the part d a diminishes the normal
size so does the opposite upper part increase beyond its normal
size the navel does not change its position to the male organ and
this shrinking arises because when a figure stands on one foot that
foot becomes the centre of gravity of the superimposed weight
this being so the middle between the shoulders is thrust above it
out of it perpendicular line and this line which forms the central
line of the external parts of the body becomes bent at its upper
extremity so as to be above the foot which supports the body and
the transverse lines are forced into such angles that their ends are

o anatomical painter beware lest the too strong indication of the
bones sinews and muscles be the cause of your becoming wooden in
your painting by your wish to make your nude figures display all
their feeling therefore in endeavouring to remedy this look in
what manner the muscles clothe or cover their bones in old or lean
persons and besides this observe the rule as to how these same
muscles fill up the spaces of the surface that extend between them
which are the muscles which never lose their prominence in any
amount of fatness and which too are the muscles of which the
attachments are lost to sight in the very least plumpness and in
many cases several muscles look like one single muscle in the
increase of fat and in many cases in growing lean or old one
single muscle divides into several muscles and in this treatise
each in its place all their peculiarities will be explainedand
particularly as to the spaces between the joints of each limb c
again do not fail to observe the variations in the forms of the
above mentioned muscles round and about the joints of the limbs of
any animal as caused by the diversity of the motions of each limb
for on some side of those joints the prominence of these muscles is
wholly lost in the increase or diminution of the flesh of which
these muscles are composed c

of the different measurements of boys and men
there is a great difference in the length between the joints in men
and boys for in man from the top of the shoulder by the neck to
the elbow and from the elbow to the tip of the thumb and from one
shoulder to the other is in each instance two heads while in a boy
it is but one because nature constructs in us the mass which is the
home of the intellect before forming that which contains the vital
elements

which are the muscles which subdivide in old age or in youth when
becoming lean which are the parts of the limbs of the human frame
where no amount of fat makes the flesh thicker nor any degree of
leanness ever diminishes it
the thing sought for in this question will be found in all the
external joints of the bones as the shoulder elbow wrists
fingerjoints hips knees anklebone and toes and the like all of
which shall be told in its place the greatest thickness acquired by
any limb is at the part of the muscles which is farthest from its
attachments
flesh never increases on those portions of the limb where the bones
are near to the surface
at b r d a c e f the increase or diminution of the flesh never
makes any considerable difference nature has placed in front of man
all those parts which feel most pain under a blow and these are the
shin of the leg the forehead and the nose and this was done for
the preservation of man since if such pain were not felt in these
parts the number of blows to which they would be exposed must be
the cause of their destruction
describe why the bones of the arm and leg are double near the hand
and foot respectively
and where the flesh is thicker or thinner in the bending of the
limbs
366
of painting
every part of the whole must be in proportion to the whole thus if
a man is of a stout short figure he will be the same in all his
parts that is with short and thick arms wide thick hands with
short fingers with their joints of the same character and so on
with the rest i would have the same thing understood as applying to
all animals and plants in diminishing the various parts do so in
due proportion to the size as also in enlarging
367
of the agreement of the proportion of the limbs
and again remember to be very careful in giving your figures limbs
that they must appear to agree with the size of the body and
likewise to the age thus a youth has limbs that are not very
muscular not strongly veined and the surface is delicate and round
and tender in colour in man the limbs are sinewy and muscular
while in old men the surface is wrinkled rugged and knotty and the
sinews very prominent
how young boys have their joints just the reverse of those of men
as to size
little children have all the joints slender and the portions between
them are thick and this happens because nothing but the skin covers
the joints without any other flesh and has the character of sinew
connecting the bones like a ligature and the fat fleshiness is laid
on between one joint and the next and between the skin and the
bones but since the bones are thicker at the joints than between
them as a mass grows up the flesh ceases to have that superfluity
which it had between the skin and the bones whence the skin clings
more closely to the bone and the limbs grow more slender but since
there is nothing over the joints but the cartilaginous and sinewy
skin this cannot dry up and not drying up cannot shrink thus
and for this reason children are slender at the joints and fat
between the joints as may be seen in the joints of the fingers
arms and shoulders which are slender and dimpled while in man on
the contrary all the joints of the fingers arms and legs are
thick and wherever children have hollows men have prominences

as to how a figure should stand with a weight in its hand footnote
8 the original text ends here remember
369
a sitting man cannot raise himself if that part of his body which is
front of his axis centre of gravity does not weigh more than that
which is behind that axis or centre without using his arms
a man who is mounting any slope finds that he must involuntarily
throw the most weight forward on the higher foot rather than
behindthat is in front of the axis and not behind it hence a man
will always involuntarily throw the greater weight towards the
point whither he desires to move than in any other direction
the faster a man runs the more he leans forward towards the point
he runs to and throws more weight in front of his axis than behind
a man who runs down hill throws the axis onto his heels and one who
runs up hill throws it into the points of his feet and a man
running on level ground throws it first on his heels and then on the
points of his feet
this man cannot carry his own weight unless by drawing his body
back he balances the weight in front in such a way as that the foot
on which he stands is the centre of gravity

370
how a man proceeds to raise himself to his feet when he is sitting
on level ground
371
a man when walking has his head in advance of his feet
a man when walking across a long level plain first leans rather
backwards and then as much forwards
footnote 36 he strides forward with the air of a man going down
hill when weary on the contrary he walks like a man going up
hill
372
a man when running throws less weight on his legs than when standing
still and in the same way a horse which is running feels less the
weight of the man he carries hence many persons think it wonderful
that in running the horse can rest on one single foot from this
it may be stated that when a weight is in progressive motion the
more rapid it is the less is the perpendicular weight towards the
centre
373
if a man in taking a jump from firm ground can leap 3 braccia and
when he was taking his leap it were to recede 13 of a braccio that
would be taken off his former leap and so if it were thrust forward
13 of a braccio by how much would his leap be increased
374
of drawing
when a man who is running wants to neutralise the impetus that
carries him on he prepares a contrary impetus which is generated by
his hanging backwards this can be proved since if the impetus
carries a moving body with a momentum equal to 4 and the moving body
wants to turn and fall back with a momentum of 4 then one momentum
neutralises the other contrary one and the impetus is neutralised
of walking up and down 375379
375
when a man wants to stop running and check the impetus he is forced
to hang back and take short quick steps footnote lines 531 refer
to the two upper figures and the lower figure to the right is
explained by the last part of the chapter the centre of gravity of
a man who lifts one of his feet from the ground always rests on the
centre of the sole of the foot he stands on
a man in going up stairs involuntarily throws so much weight
forward and on the side of the upper foot as to be a counterpoise to
the lower leg so that the labour of this lower leg is limited to
moving itself
the first thing a man does in mounting steps is to relieve the leg
he is about to lift of the weight of the body which was resting on
that leg and besides this he gives to the opposite leg all the
rest of the bulk of the whole man including the weight of the
other leg he then raises the other leg and sets the foot upon the
step to which he wishes to raise himself having done this he
restores to the upper foot all the weight of the body and of the leg
itself and places his hand on his thigh and throws his head forward
and repeats the movement towards the point of the upper foot
quickly lifting the heel of the lower one and with this impetus he
lifts himself up and at the same time extends the arm which rested
on his knee and this extension of the arm carries up the body and
the head and so straightens the spine which was curved
32 the higher the step is which a man has to mount the farther
forward will he place his head in advance of his upper foot so as
to weigh more on a than on b this man will not be on the step
m as is shown by the line g f
footnote see pl xxiii no 1 the lower sketch to the left
belongs to the four first lines

these steps what weight he gives to b and to c

in going up stairs if you place your hands on your knees all the
labour taken by the arms is removed from the sinews at the back of
the knees
footnote see pl xxiii no 3
378
the sinew which guides the leg and which is connected with the
patella of the knee feels it a greater labour to carry the man
upwards in proportion as the leg is more bent and the muscle which
acts upon the angle made by the thigh where it joins the body has
less difficulty and has a less weight to lift because it has not
the additional weight of the thigh itself and besides this it has
stronger muscles being those which form the buttock
379
a man coming down hill takes little steps because the weight rests
upon the hinder foot while a man mounting takes wide steps because
his weight rests on the foremost foot

on the human body in action 380388
380
of the human body in action
when you want to represent a man as moving some weight consider what
the movements are that are to be represented by different lines
that is to say either from below upwards with a simple movement as
a man does who stoops forward to take up a weight which he will lift
as he straightens himself or as a man does who wants to squash
something backwards or to force it forwards or to pull it downwards
with ropes passed through pullies footnote 10 compare the sketch
on page 198 and on 201 s k m ii1 86b and here remember that
the weight of a man pulls in proportion as his centre of gravity is
distant from his fulcrum and to this is added the force given by
his legs and bent back as he raises himself
381
again a man has even a greater store of strength in his legs than
he needs for his own weight and to see if this is true make a man
stand on the shoresand and then put another man on his back and
you will see how much he will sink in then take the man from off
his back and make him jump straight up as high as he can and you
will find that the print of his feet will be made deeper by the jump
than from having the man on his back hence here by 2 methods it
is proved that a man has double the strength he requires to support
his own body
382
of painting
if you have to draw a man who is in motion or lifting or pulling
or carrying a weight equal to his own in what way must you set on
his legs below his body
footnote in the ms this question remains unanswered
383
of the strength of man
a man pulling a dead weight balanced against himself cannot pull
more than his own weight and if he has to raise it he will be able
to raise as much more than his weight as his strength may be more
than that of other men footnote 7 the stroke at the end of this
line finishes in the original in a sort of loop or flourish and a
similar flourish occurs at the end of the previous passage written
on the same page m ravaisson regards these as numbers compare the
photograph of page 30b in his edition of ms a he remarks ce
chiffre 8 et a la fin de lalinea precedent le chiffre 7 sont
dans le manuscrit des renvois the greatest force a man can
apply with equal velocity and impetus will be when he sets his
feet on one end of the balance or lever and then presses his
shoulders against some stable body this will raise a weight at the
other end of the balance lever equal to his own weight and added
to that as much weight as he can carry on his shoulders
384
no animal can simply move by its dead weight a greater weight than
the sum of its own weight outside the centre of his fulcrum
385
a man who wants to send an arrow very far from the bow must be
standing entirely on one foot and raising the other so far from the
foot he stands on as to afford the requisite counterpoise to his
body which is thrown on the front foot and he must not hold his arm
fully extended and in order that he may be more able to bear the
strain he must hold a piece of wood which there is in all crossbows
extending from the hand to the breast and when he wishes to shoot
he suddenly leaps forward at the same instant and extends his arm
with the bow and releases the string and if he dexterously does
every thing at once it will go a very long way
386
when two men are at the opposite ends of a plank that is balanced
and if they are of equal weight and if one of them wants to make a
leap into the air then his leap will be made down from his end of
the plank and the man will never go up again but must remain in his
place till the man at the other end dashes up the board

why an impetus is not spent at once but diminishes gradually in
some one direction footnote 1 the paper has been damaged at the
end of line 1 the impetus acquired in the line a b c d is spent
in the line d e but not so completely but that some of its force
remains in it and to this force is added the momentum in the line d
e with the force of the motive power and it must follow than the
impetus multiplied by the blow is greater that the simple impetus
produced by the momentum d e
footnote 8 the sketch no 2 on pl xxiv stands in the original
between lines 7 and 8 compare also the sketches on pl liv a man
who has to deal a great blow with his weapon prepares himself with
all his force on the opposite side to that where the spot is which
he is to hit and this is because a body as it gains in velocity
gains in force against the object which impedes its motion
on hair falling down in curls
389
observe the motion of the surface of the water which resembles that
of hair and has two motions of which one goes on with the flow of
the surface the other forms the lines of the eddies thus the water
forms eddying whirlpools one part of which are due to the impetus of
the principal current and the other to the incidental motion and
return flow

on draperies 390392
390
of the nature of the folds in drapery
that part of a fold which is farthest from the ends where it is
confined will fall most nearly in its natural form
every thing by nature tends to remain at rest drapery being of
equal density and thickness on its wrong side and on its right has
a tendency to lie flat therefore when you give it a fold or plait
forcing it out of its flatness note well the result of the
constraint in the part where it is most confined and the part which
is farthest from this constraint you will see relapses most into the
natural state that is to say lies free and flowing
example
footnote 13 a c sia in the original text b is written instead
of can evident slip of the pen let a b c be the fold of the
drapery spoken of above a c will be the places where this folded
drapery is held fast i maintain that the part of the drapery which
is farthest from the plaited ends will revert most to its natural
form
therefore b being farthest from a and c in the fold a b c
it will be wider there than anywhere else
footnote see pl xxviii no 6 and compare the drawing from
windsor pl xxx for farther illustration of what is here stated
391
of small folds in draperies
how figures dressed in a cloak should not show the shape so much as
that the cloak looks as if it were next the flesh since you surely
cannot wish the cloak to be next the flesh for you must suppose
that between the flesh and the cloak there are other garments which
prevent the forms of the limbs appearing distinctly through the
cloak and those limbs which you allow to be seen you must make
thicker so that the other garments may appear to be under the cloak
but only give something of the true thickness of the limbs to a
nymph footnote 9 una nifa compare the beautiful drawing of a
nymph in black chalk from the windsor collection pl xxvi or an
angel which are represented in thin draperies pressed and clinging
to the limbs of the figures by the action of the wind
392
you ought not to give to drapery a great confusion of many folds
but rather only introduce them where they are held by the hands or
the arms the rest you may let fall simply where it is its nature to
flow and do not let the nude forms be broken by too many details
and interrupted folds how draperies should be drawn from nature
that is to say if youwant to represent woollen cloth draw the folds
from that and if it is to be silk or fine cloth or coarse or of
linen or of crape vary the folds in each and do not represent
dresses as many do from models covered with paper or thin leather
which will deceive you greatly
footnote the little pen and ink drawing from windsor w 102

at the beginning of this passage the writing of the cipher 19 on
the same page is in leonardos hand the cipher 21 is certainly
not

botany for painters and elements of landscape painting
the chapters composing this portion of the work consist of
observations on form light and shade in plants and particularly in
trees summed up in certain general rules by which the author intends
to guide the artist in the pictorial representation of landscape
with these the first principles of a theory of landscape painting
are laid downa theory as profoundly thought out in its main
lines as it is lucidly worked out in its details in reading these
chapters the conviction is irresistible that such a botany for
painters is or ought to be of similar importance in the practice of
painting as the principles of the proportions and movements of the
human figure i e anatomy for painters
there can be no doubt that leonardo in laying down these rules
did not intend to write on botany in the proper scientific
sensehis own researches on that subject have no place here it
need only be observed that they are easily distinguished by their
character and contents from those which are here collected and
arranged under the title botany for painters in some cases where
this division might appear doubtfulas for instance in no
402the painter is directly addressed and enjoined to take the
rule to heart as of special importance in his art
the original materials are principally derived from ms g in
which we often find this subject treated on several pages in
succession without any of that intermixture of other matters which
is so frequent in leonardos writings this ms too is one of the
latest when it was written the great painter was already more than
sixty years of age so we can scarcely doubt that he regarded all he
wrote as his final views on the subject and the same remark applies
to the chapters from mss e and m which were also written
between 151315
for the sake of clearness however it has been desirable to
sacrificewith few exceptionsthe original order of the passages
as written though it was with much reluctance and only after long
hesitation that i resigned myself to this necessity nor do i mean
to impugn the logical connection of the authors ideas in his ms
but it will be easily understood that the sequence of disconnected
notes as they occurred to leonardo and were written down from time
to time might be hardly satisfactory as a systematic arrangement of
his principles the reader will find in the appendix an exact
account of the order of the chapters in the original ms and from
the data there given can restore them at will as the materials are
here arranged the structure of the tree as regards the growth of
the branches comes first 394411 and then the insertion of the
leaves on the stems 412419 then follow the laws of light and
shade as applied first to the leaves 420434 and secondly to
the whole tree and to groups of trees 435457 after the remarks
on the light and shade in landscapes generally 458464 we find
special observations on that of views of towns and buildings
465469 to the theory of landscape painting belong also the
passages on the effect of wind on trees 470473 and on the light
and shade of clouds 474477 since we find in these certain
comparisons with the effect of light and shade on trees e g in
no 476 4 5 and no 477 9 12 the chapters given in the
appendix nos 478 and 481 have hardly any connection with the
subjects previously treated
classification of trees
393
trees
small lofty straggling thick that is as to foliage dark light
russet branched at the top some directed towards the eye some
downwards with white stems this transparent in the air that not
some standing close together some scattered
the relative thickness of the branches to the trunk 393396
394
all the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put
together are equal in thickness to the trunk below them
all the branches of a water course at every stage of its course
if they are of equal rapidity are equal to the body of the main
stream
395
every year when the boughs of a plant or tree have made an end of
maturing their growth they will have made when put together a
thickness equal to that of the main stem and at every stage of its
ramification you will find the thickness of the said main stem as
i k g h e f c d a b will always be equal to each
other unless the tree is pollardif so the rule does not hold
good
all the branches have a direction which tends to the centre of the
tree m
footnote the two sketches of leafless trees one above another on
the left hand side of pl xxvii no 1 belong to this passage
396
if the plant n grows to the thickness shown at m its branches will
correspond in thickness to the junction a b in consequence of the
growth inside as well as outside
the branches of trees or plants have a twist wherever a minor branch
is given off and this giving off the branch forms a fork this said
fork occurs between two angles of which the largest will be that
which is on the side of the larger branch and in proportion unless
accident has spoilt it
footnote the sketches illustrating this are on the right hand side
of pi xxvii no i and the text is also given there in facsimile
397
there is no boss on branches which has not been produced by some
branch which has failed
the lower shoots on the branches of trees grow more than the upper
ones and this occurs only because the sap that nourishes them being
heavy tends downwards more than upwards and again because those
branches which grow downwards turn away from the shade which
exists towards the centre of the plant the older the branches are
the greater is the difference between their upper and their lower
shoots and in those dating from the same year or epoch
footnote the sketch accompanying this in the ms is so effaced
that an exact reproduction was impossible
398
of the scars on trees
the scars on trees grow to a greater thickness than is required by
the sap of the limb which nourishes them
399
the plant which gives out the smallest ramifications will preserve
the straightest line in the course of its growth
footnote this passage is illustrated by two partly effaced
sketches one of these closely resembles the lower one given under
no 408 the other also represents short closely set boughs on an
upright trunk
400
of the ramification
the beginning of the ramification the shoot always has the central
line axis of its thickness directed to the central line axis of
the plant itself
401
in starting from the main stem the branches always form a base with
a prominence as is shown at a b c d
402
why very frequently timber has veins that are not straight
when the branches which grow the second year above the branch of the
preceding year are not of equal thickness above the antecedent
branches but are on one side then the vigour of the lower branch
is diverted to nourish the one above it although it may be somewhat
on one side
but if the ramifications are equal in their growth the veins of the
main stem will be straight parallel and equidistant at every
degree of the height of the plant
wherefore o painter you who do not know these laws in order to
escape the blame of those who understand them it will be well that
you should represent every thing from nature and not despise such
study as those do who work only for money
the direction of growth 403407
403
of the ramifications of plants
the plants which spread very much have the angles of the spaces
which divide their branches more obtuse in proportion as their point
of origin is lower down that is nearer to the thickest and oldest
portion of the tree therefore in the youngest portions of the tree
the angles of ramification are more acute footnote compare the
sketches on the lower portion of pl xxvii no 2
404
the tips of the boughs of plants and trees unless they are borne
down by the weight of their fruits turn towards the sky as much as
possible
the upper side of their leaves is turned towards the sky that it may
receive the nourishment of the dew which falls at night
the sun gives spirit and life to plants and the earth nourishes them
with moisture 9 with regard to this i made the experiment of
leaving only one small root on a gourd and this i kept nourished
with water and the gourd brought to perfection all the fruits it
could produce which were about 60 gourds of the long kind andi set
my mind diligently to consider this vitality and perceived that
the dews of night were what supplied it abundantly with moisture
through the insertion of its large leaves and gave nourishment to
the plant and its offspringor the seeds which its offspring had
to produce21
the rule of the leaves produced on the last shoot of the year will
be that they will grow in a contrary direction on the twin branches
that is that the insertion of the leaves turns round each branch in
such a way as that the sixth leaf above is produced over the sixth
leaf below and the way they turn is that if one turns towards its
companion to the right the other turns to the left the leaf
serving as the nourishing breast for the shoot or fruit which grows
the following year
footnote a french translation of lines 912 was given by m
ravaisson in the gazette des beaux arts oct 1877 his paper also
contains some valuable information as to botanical science in the
ancient classical writers and at the time of the renaissance
405
the lowest branches of those trees which have large leaves and heavy
fruits such as nuttrees figtrees and the like always droop
towards the ground
the branches always originate above in the axis of the leaves
406
the upper shoots of the lateral branches of plants lie closer to the
parent branch than the lower ones
407
the lowest branches after they have formed the angle of their
separation from the parent stem always bend downwards so as not to
crowd against the other branches which follow them on the same stem
and to be better able to take the air which nourishes them as is
shown by the angle b a c the branch a c after it has made the
corner of the angle a c bends downwards to c d and the lesser
shoot c dries up being too thin
the main branch always goes below as is shown by the branch f n
m which does not go to f n o
the forms of trees 408411
408
the elm always gives a greater length to the last branches of the
years growth than to the lower ones and nature does this because
the highest branches are those which have to add to the size of the
tree and those at the bottom must get dry because they grow in the
shade and their growth would be an impediment to the entrance of the
solar rays and the air among the main branches of the tree
the main branches of the lower part bend down more than those above
so as to be more oblique than those upper ones and also because
they are larger and older
409
in general almost all the upright portions of trees curve somewhat
turning the convexity towards the south and their branches are
longer and thicker and more abundant towards the south than towards
the north and this occurs because the sun draws the sap towards
that surface of the tree which is nearest to it
and this may be observed if the sun is not screened off by other
plants
410
the cherrytree is of the character of the fir tree as regards its
ramification placed in stages round its main stem and its branches
spring 4 or five or 6 together opposite each other and the tips
of the topmost shoots form a pyramid from the middle upwards and
the walnut and oak form a hemisphere from the middle upwards

modes only three are described in the text the fourth is only
suggested by a sketch
this passage occurs in manzis edition of the trattato p 399 but
without the sketches and the text is mutilated in an important part
the whole passage has been commented on from manzis version in
part i of the nuovo giornale botanico italiano by prof g
uzielli florence 1869 vol i he remarks as to the four modes

been written on the margin and in it as well as in ludwigs and

above another the first which is the most general is that the
sixth always originates over the sixth below footnote 8 la sesta

413
a description of the elm
the ramification of the elm has the largest branch at the top the
first and the last but one are smaller when the main trunk is
straight
the space between the insertion of one leaf to the rest is half the
extreme length of the leaf or somewhat less for the leaves are at
an interval which is about the 3rd of the width of the leaf
the elm has more leaves near the top of the boughs than at the base
and the broad surface of the leaves varies little as to angle
and aspect
footnote see pl xxvii no 3 above the sketch and close under
the number of the page is the word olmo elm
414
in the walnut tree the leaves which are distributed on the shoots of
this year are further apart from each other and more numerous in
proportion as the branch from which this shoot springs is a young
one and they are inserted more closely and less in number when the
shoot that bears them springs from an old branch its fruits are
borne at the ends of the shoots and its largest boughs are the
lowest on the boughs they spring from and this arises from the
weight of its sap which is more apt to descend than to rise and
consequently the branches which spring from them and rise towards
the sky are small and slender 20 and when the shoot turns towards
the sky its leaves spread out from it at an angle with an equal
distribution of their tips and if the shoot turns to the horizon
the leaves lie flat and this arises from the fact that leaves
without exception turn their underside to the earth 29
the shoots are smaller in proportion as they spring nearer to the
base of the bough they spring from
footnote see the two sketches on pl xxvii no 4 the second
refers to the passage lines 2030
415
of the insertion of the leaves on the branches
the thickness of a branch never diminishes within the space between
one leaf and the next excepting by so much as the thickness of the
bud which is above the leaf and this thickness is taken off from the
branch above the node as far as the next leaf
nature has so placed the leaves of the latest shoots of many plants
that the sixth leaf is always above the first and so on in
succession if the rule is not accidentally interfered with and
this occurs for two useful ends in the plant first that as the
shoot and the fruit of the following year spring from the bud or eye
which lies above and in close contact with the insertion of the leaf
in the axil the water which falls upon the shoot can run down to
nourish the bud by the drop being caught in the hollow axil at
the insertion of the leaf and the second advantage is that as
these shoots develop in the following year one will not cover the
next below since the 5 come forth on five different sides and the
sixth which is above the first is at some distance
416
of the ramifications of trees and their foliage
the ramifications of any tree such as the elm are wide and slender
after the manner of a hand with spread fingers foreshortened and
these are seen in the distribution thus the lower portions are
seen from above and those that are above are seen from below and
those in the middle some from below and some from above the upper
part is the extreme top of this ramification and the middle
portion is more foreshortened than any other of those which are
turned with their tips towards you and of those parts of the middle
of the height of the tree the longest will be towards the top of
the tree and will produce a ramification like the foliage of the
common willow which grows on the banks of rivers
other ramifications are spherical as those of such trees as put
forth their shoots and leaves in the order of the sixth being placed
above the first others are thin and light like the willow and
others
417
you will see in the lower branches of the elder which puts forth
leaves two and two placed crosswise at right angles one above
another that if the stem rises straight up towards the sky this
order never fails and its largest leaves are on the thickest part
of the stem and the smallest on the slenderest part that is towards
the top but to return to the lower branches i say that the leaves
on these are placed on them crosswise like those on the upper
branches and as by the law of all leaves they are compelled to
turn their upper surface towards the sky to catch the dew at night
it is necessary that those so placed should twist round and no
longer form a cross
footnote see pl xxvii no 5
418
a leaf always turns its upper side towards the sky so that it may
the better receive on all its surface the dew which drops gently
from the atmosphere and these leaves are so distributed on the
plant as that one shall cover the other as little as possible but
shall lie alternately one above another as may be seen in the ivy
which covers the walls and this alternation serves two ends that
is to leave intervals by which the air and sun may penetrate
between them the 2nd reason is that the drops which fall from the
first leaf may fall onto the fourth orin other treesonto the
sixth
419
every shoot and every fruit is produced above the insertion in the
axil of its leaf which serves it as a mother giving it water from
the rain and moisture from the dew which falls at night from above
and often it protects them against the too great heat of the rays of
the sun
light on branches and leaves 420422
420
that part of the body will be most illuminated which is hit by the
luminous ray coming between right angles
footnote see pl xxviii no 1
421
young plants have more transparent leaves and a more lustrous bark
than old ones and particularly the walnut is lighter coloured in
may than in september
422
of the accidents of colouring in trees
the accidents of colour in the foliage of trees are 4 that is
shadow light lustre reflected light and transparency
of the visibility of these accidents
these accidents of colour in the foliage of trees become confused at
a great distance and that which has most breadth whether light or
shade c will be most conspicuous
the proportions of light and shade in a leaf 423426
423
of the shadows of a leaf
sometimes a leaf has three accidents of light that is shade
lustre reflected light and transparency transmitted light thus
if the light were at n as regards the leaf s and the eye at
m it would see a in full light b in shadow and c
transparent
424
a leaf with a concave surface seen from the under side and
upsidedown will sometimes show itself as half in shade and half
transparent thus if o p is the leaf and the light m and the
eye n this will see o in shadow because the light does not fall
upon it between equal angles neither on the upper nor the under
side and p is lighted on the upper side and the light is
transmitted to its under side footnote see pl xxviii no 2 the
upper sketch on the page in the original they are drawn in red
chalk
425
although those leaves which have a polished surface are to a great
extent of the same colour on the right side and on the reverse it
may happen that the side which is turned towards the atmosphere will
have something of the colour of the atmosphere and it will seem to
have more of this colour of the atmosphere in proportion as the eye
is nearer to it and sees it more foreshortened and without
exception the shadows show as darker on the upper side than on the
lower from the contrast offered by the high lights which limit the
shadows
the under side of the leaf although its colour may be in itself the
same as that of the upper side shows a still finer coloura colour
that is green verging on yellowand this happens when the leaf is
placed between
426
the eye and the light which falls upon it from the opposite side
and its shadows are in the same positions as those were of the
opposite side therefore o painter when you do trees close at
hand remember that if the eye is almost under the tree you will see
its leaves some on the upper and some on the under side and the
upper side will be bluer in proportion as they are seen more
foreshortened and the same leaf sometimes shows part of the right
side and part of the under side whence you must make it of two
colours
of the transparency of leaves 427429
427
the shadows in transparent leaves seen from the under side are the
same shadows as there are on the right side of this leaf they will
show through to the underside together with lights but the lustre
reflected light can never show through
428
when one green has another green behind it the lustre on the
leaves and their transparent lights show more strongly than in
those which are seen against the brightness of the atmosphere
and if the sun illuminates the leaves without their coming between
it and the eye and without the eye facing the sun then the
reflected lights and the transparent lights are very strong
it is very effective to show some branches which are low down and
dark and so set off the illuminated greens which are at some
distance from the dark greens seen below that part is darkest which
is nearest to the eye or which is farthest from the luminous
atmosphere
429
never paint leaves transparent to the sun because they are
confused and this is because on the transparency of one leaf will
be seen the shadow of another leaf which is above it this shadow
has a distinct outline and a certain depth of shade and sometimes is
as much as half or a third of the leaf which is shaded and
consequently such an arrangement is very confused and the imitation
of it should be avoided
the light shines least through a leaf when it falls upon it at an
acute angle
the gradations of shade and colour in leaves 430434
430
the shadows of plants are never black for where the atmosphere
penetrates there can never be utter darkness
431
if the light comes from m and the eye is at n the eye will see
the colour of the leaves a b all affected by the colour of m
that is of the atmosphere and b c will be seen from the under
side as transparent with a beautiful green colour verging on
yellow
if m is the luminous body lighting up the leaf s all the eyes
that see the under side of this leaf will see it of a beautiful
light green being transparent
in very many cases the positions of the leaves will be without
shadow or in full light and their under side will be transparent
and the right side lustrous reflecting light
432
the willow and other similar trees which have their boughs lopped
every 3 or 4 years put forth very straight branches and their
shadow is about the middle where these boughs spring and towards
the extreme ends they cast but little shade from having small leaves
and few and slender branches hence the boughs which rise towards
the sky will have but little shade and little relief and the
branches which are at an angle from the horizon downwards spring
from the dark part of the shadow and grow thinner by degrees up to
their ends and these will be in strong relief being in gradations
of light against a background of shadow
that tree will have the least shadow which has the fewest branches
and few leaves
433
of dark leaves in front of transparent ones
when the leaves are interposed between the light and the eye then
that which is nearest to the eye will be the darkest and the most
distant will be the lightest not being seen against the atmosphere
and this is seen in the leaves which are away from the centre of the
tree that is towards the light
footnote see pl xxviii no 2 the lower sketch
434
of the lights on dark leaves
the lights on such leaves which are darkest will be most near to
the colour of the atmosphere that is reflected in them and the
cause of this is that the light on the illuminated portion mingles
with the dark hue to compose a blue colour and this light is
produced by the blueness of the atmosphere which is reflected in the
smooth surface of these leaves and adds to the blue hue which this
light usually produces when it falls on dark objects
of the lights on leaves of a yellowish green
but leaves of a green verging on yellow when they reflect the
atmosphere do not produce a reflection verging on blue inasmuch as
every thing which appears in a mirror takes some colour from that
mirror hence the blue of the atmosphere being reflected in the
yellow of the leaf appears green because blue and yellow mixed
together make a very fine green colour therefore the lustre of
light leaves verging on yellow will be greenish yellow
a classification of trees according to their colours
435
the trees in a landscape are of various kinds of green inasmuch as
some verge towards blackness as firs pines cypresses laurels
box and the like some tend to yellow such as walnuts and pears
vines and verdure some are both yellowish and dark as chesnuts
holmoak some turn red in autumn as the servicetree pomegranate
vine and cherry and some are whitish as the willow olive reeds
and the like trees are of various forms

436
of a generally distributed light as lighting up trees
that part of the trees will be seen to lie in the least dark shadow
which is farthest from the earth
to prove it let a p be the tree n b c the illuminated
hemisphere the sky the under portion of the tree faces the earth
p c that is on the side o and it faces a small part of the
hemisphere at c d but the highest part of the convexity a faces
the greatest part of the hemisphere that is b c for this
reasonand because it does not face the darkness of the earthit
is in fuller light but if the tree has dense foliage as the
laurel arbutus box or holm oak it will be different because
although a does not face the earth it faces the dark green of
the leaves cut up by many shadows and this darkness is reflected
onto the under sides of the leaves immediately above thus these
trees have their darkest shadows nearest to the middle of the tree
437
of the shadows of verdure
the shadows of verdure are always somewhat blue and so is every
shadow of every object and they assume this hue more in proportion
as they are remote from the eye and less in proportion as they are
nearer the leaves which reflect the blue of the atmosphere always
present themselves to the eye edgewise
of the illuminated part of verdure and of mountains
the illuminated portion at a great distance will appear most
nearly of its natural colour where the strongest light falls upon
it
438
of trees that are lighted by the sun and by the atmosphere
in trees that are illuminated both by the sun and the atmosphere
and that have leaves of a dark colour one side will be illuminated
by the atmosphere only and in consequence of this light will tend
to blueness while on the other side they will be illuminated by the
atmosphere and the sun and the side which the eye sees illuminated
by the sun will reflect light
439
of depicting a forest scene
the trees and plants which are most thickly branched with slender
branches ought to have less dark shadow than those trees and plants
which having broader leaves will cast more shadow

on painting
in the position of the eye which sees that portion of a tree
illuminated which turns towards the light one tree will never be
seen to be illuminated equally with the other to prove this let
the eye be c which sees the two trees b d which are illuminated
by the sun a i say that this eye c will not see the light in
the same proportion to the shade in one tree as in the other
because the tree which is nearest to the sun will display so much
the stronger shadow than the more distant one in proportion as one
tree is nearer to the rays of the sun that converge to the eye than
the other c
you see that the eye c sees nothing of the tree d but shadow
while the same eye c sees the tree b half in light and half in
shade
when a tree is seen from below the eye sees the top of it as placed
within the circle made by its boughs23
remember o painter that the variety of depth of shade in any one
particular species of tree is in proportion to the rarity or density
of their branches

the shadows of trees placed in a landscape do not display themselves

left still more so if the sun is to the right or left as is proved
by the 4th which says opaque bodies placed between the light and
the eye display themselves entirely in shadow and by the 5th the
eye when placed between the opaque body and the light sees the
opaque body entirely illuminated and by the 6th when the eye and
the opaque body are placed between darkness and light it will be
seen half in shadow and half in light

443
from whence to depict a landscape
landscapes should be represented so that the trees may be half in
light and half in shadow but it is better to do them when the sun
is covered with clouds for then the trees are lighted by the
general light of the sky and the general darkness of the earth and
then they are darkest in certain parts in proportion as those parts
are nearest to the middle of the tree and to the earth
the effects of morning light 444448
444
of trees to the south
when the sun is in the east the trees to the south and to the north
have almost as much light as shadow but a greater share of light in
proportion as they lie to the west and a greater share of shadow in
proportion as they lie to the east
of meadows
if the sun is in the east the verdure of the meadows and of other
small plants is of a most beautiful green from being transparent to
the sun this does not occur in the meadows to the west and in
those to the south and north the grass is of a moderately brilliant
green
445
of the 4 points of the compass in landscapes
when the sun is in the east all the portions of plants lighted by it
are of a most lively verdure and this happens because the leaves
lighted by the sun within the half of the horizon that is the
eastern half are transparent and within the western semicircle the
verdure is of a dull hue and the moist air is turbid and of the
colour of grey ashes not being transparent like that in the east
which is quite clear and all the more so in proportion as it is
moister
the shadows of the trees to the east cover a large portion of them
and are darker in proportion as the foliage of the trees is thicker
446
of trees in the east
when the sun is in the east the trees seen towards the east will
have the light which surrounds them all round their shadows
excepting on the side towards the earth unless the tree has been
pruned below in the past year and the trees to the south and
north will be half in shade and half in light and more or less in
shade or in light in proportion as they are more or less to the east
or to the west
the position of the eye above or below varies the shadows and
lights in trees inasmuch as the eye placed above sees the tree with
the little shadow and the eye placed below with a great deal of
shadow
the colour of the green in plants varies as much as their species
447
of the shadows in trees
the sun being in the east to the right the trees to the west or
left of the eye will show in small relief and almost imperceptible
gradations because the atmosphere which lies between the eye and
those trees is very dense footnote 7 per la 7a di questo this
possibly referred to something written on the seventh page of this
note book marked g unfortunately it has been cut out and lost
see the 7th of thisand they have no shade for though a shadow
exists in every detail of the ramification it results that the
images of the shade and light that reach the eye are confused and
mingled together and cannot be perceived on account of their
minuteness and the principal lights are in the middle of the trees
and the shadows to wards the edges and their separation is shown by
the shadows of the intervals between the trees but when the forests
are thick with trees the thin edges are but little seen
448
of trees to the east
when the sun is in the east the trees are darker towards the middle
while their edges are light

449
objects in high light show but little but between light and shadow
they stand out well
to represent a landscape choose that the sun shall be at noon and
look towards the west or east and then draw and if you turn towards
the north every object placed on that side will have no shadow
particularly those which are nearest to the direction of the
shadow of your head and if you turn towards the south every object
on that side will be wholly in shadow all the trees which are
towards the sun and have the atmosphere for their background are
dark and the other trees which lie against that darkness will be
black very dark in the middle and lighter towards the edges
the appearance of trees in the distance 450 451
450
of the spaces showing the sky in trees themselves
the spaces between the parts in the mass of trees and the spaces
between the trees in the air are at great distances invisible to
the eye for where it is an effort even to see the whole it is
most difficult to discern the partsbut a confused mixture is the
result partaking chiefly of the hue which predominates the
spaces between the leaves consist of particles of illuminated air
which are very much smaller than the tree and are lost sight of
sooner than the tree but it does not therefore follow that they are
not there hence necessarily a compounded effect is produced of
the sky and of the shadows of the tree in shade which both together
strike the eye which sees them
of trees which conceal these spaces in one another
that part of a tree will show the fewest spaces behind which a
large number of trees are standing between the tree and the air
sky thus in the tree a the spaces are not concealed nor in b
as there is no tree behind but in c only half shows the spaces
filled up by the tree d and part of the tree d is filled up by
the tree e and a little farther on all the spaces in the mass of
the trees are lost and only that at the side remains
451
of trees
what outlines are seen in trees at a distance against the sky which
serves as their background
the outlines of the ramification of trees where they lie against
the illuminated sky display a form which more nearly approaches the
spherical on proportion as they are remote and the nearer they are
the less they appear in this spherical form as in the first tree
a which being near to the eye displays the true form of its
ramification but this shows less in b and is altogether lost in
c where not merely the branches of the tree cannot be seen but
the whole tree is distinguished with difficulty every object in
shadow of whatever form it may be at a great distance appears to
be spherical and this occurs because if it is a square body at a
very short distance it loses its angles and a little farther off it
loses still more of its smaller sides which remain and thus before
the whole is lost to sight the parts are lost being smaller than
the whole as a man who in such a distant position loses his legs
arms and head before the mass of his body then the outlines of
length are lost before those of breadth and where they have become
equal it would be a square if the angles remained but as they are
lost it is round

453
all trees seen against the sun are dark towards the middle and this
shadow will be of the shape of the tree when apart from others
the shadows cast by trees on which the sun shines are as dark as
those of the middle of the tree
the shadow cast by a tree is never less than the mass of the tree
but becomes taller in proportion as the spot on which it falls
slopes towards the centre of the world
the shadow will be densest in the middle of the tree when the tree
has the fewest branches

in the original before lines 711 at the spots marked b leonardo
wrote albero tree at a is the word sole sun at c monte
mountain at d piano plain and at e cima summit
every branch participates of the central shadow of every other
branch and consequently of that of the whole tree
the form of any shadow from a branch or tree is circumscribed by the
light which falls from the side whence the light comes and this
illumination gives the shape of the shadow and this may be of the
distance of a mile from the side where the sun is
if it happens that a cloud should anywhere overshadow some part of a
hill the shadow of the trees there will change less than in the
plains for these trees on the hills have their branches thicker
because they grow less high each year than in the plains therefore
as these branches are dark by nature and being so full of shade the
shadow of the clouds cannot darken them any more but the open
spaces between the trees which have no strong shadow change very
much in tone and particularly those which vary from green that is
ploughed lands or fallen mountains or barren lands or rocks where
the trees are against the atmosphere they appear all the same
colourif indeed they are not very close together or very thickly
covered with leaves like the fir and similar trees when you see the
trees from the side from which the sun lights them you will see
them almost all of the same tone and the shadows in them will be
hidden by the leaves in the light which come between your eye and
those shadows
trees at a short distance
footnote 29 the heading alberi vicini trees at a short
distance is in the original manuscript written in the margin when
the trees are situated between the sun and the eye beyond the
shadow which spreads from their centre the green of their leaves
will be seen transparent but this transparency will be broken in
many places by the leaves and boughs in shadow which will come
between you and them or in their upper portions they will be
accompanied by many lights reflected from the leaves
454
the trees of the landscape stand out but little from each other
because their illuminated portions come against the illuminated
portions of those beyond and differ little from them in light and
shade
455
of trees seen from below and against the light one beyond the other
and near together the topmost part of the first will be in great
part transparent and light and will stand out against the dark
portion of the second tree and thus it will be with all in
succession that are placed under the same conditions
let s be the light and r the eye c d n the first tree a b
c the second then i say that r the eye will see the portion c
f in great part transparent and lighted by the light s which
falls upon it from the opposite side and it will see it on a dark
ground b c because that is the dark part and shadow of the tree a
b c
but if the eye is placed at t it will see o p dark on the light
background n g
of the transparent and shadowy parts of trees that which is nearest
to you is the darkest
456
that part of a tree which has shadow for background is all of one
tone and wherever the trees or branches are thickest they will be
darkest because there are no little intervals of air but where the
boughs lie against a background of other boughs the brighter parts
are seen lightest and the leaves lustrous from the sunlight falling
on them
457
in the composition of leafy trees be careful not to repeat too often
the same colour of one tree against the same colour of another
behind it but vary it with a lighter or a darker or a stronger
green
on the treatment of light for landscapes 458464
458
the landscape has a finer azure tone when in fine weather the sun
is at noon than at any other time of the day because the air is
purified of moisture and looking at it under that aspect you will
see the trees of a beautiful green at the outside and the shadows
dark towards the middle and in the remoter distance the atmosphere
which comes between you and them looks more beautiful when there is
something dark beyond and still the azure is most beautiful the
objects seen from the side on which the sun shines will not show you
their shadows but if you are lower than the sun you can see what
is not seen by the sun and that will be all in shade the leaves of
the trees which come between you and the sun are of two principal
colours which are a splendid lustre of green and the reflection of
the atmosphere which lights up the objects which cannot be seen by
the sun and the shaded portions which only face the earth and the
darkest which are surrounded by something that is not dark the
trees in the landscape which are between you and the sun are far
more beautiful than those you see when you are between the sun and
them and this is so because those which face the sun show their
leaves as transparent towards the ends of their branches and those
that are not transparentthat is at the endsreflect the light
and the shadows are dark because they are not concealed by any
thing
the trees when you place yourself between them and the sun will
only display to you their light and natural colour which in
itself is not very strong and besides this some reflected lights
which being against a background which does not differ very much
from themselves in tone are not conspicuous and if you are lower
down than they are situated they may also show those portions on
which the light of the sun does not fall and these will be dark
in the wind
but if you are on the side whence the wind blows you will see the
trees look very much lighter than on the other sides and this
happens because the wind turns up the under side of the leaves
which in all trees is much whiter than the upper sides and more
especially will they be very light indeed if the wind blows from
the quarter where the sun is and if you have your back turned to
it
footnote at s in the original is the word sole sun and at
n parte di nuvolo the side of the clouds
459
when the sun is covered by clouds objects are less conspicuous
because there is little difference between the light and shade of
the trees and of the buildings being illuminated by the brightness
of the atmosphere which surrounds the objects in such a way that the
shadows are few and these few fade away so that their outline is
lost in haze
460
of trees and lights on them
the best method of practice in representing country scenes or i
should say landscapes with their trees is to choose them so that
the sun is covered with clouds so that the landscape receives an
universal light and not the direct light of the sun which makes the
shadows sharp and too strongly different from the lights
461
of painting
in landscapes which represent a scene in winter the mountains
should not be shown blue as we see in the mountains in the summer
and this is proved footnote 5 6 per la 4a di questo it is
impossible to ascertain what this quotation refers to questo
certainly does not mean the ms in hand nor any other now known to
us the same remark applies to the phrase in line 15 per la 2a
di questo in the 4th of this which says among mountains seen
from a great distance those will look of the bluest colour which are
in themselves the darkest hence when the trees are stripped of
their leaves they will show a bluer tinge which will be in itself
darker therefore when the trees have lost their leaves they will
look of a gray colour while with their leaves they are green and
in proportion as the green is darker than the grey hue the green
will be of a bluer tinge than the gray also by the 2nd of this the
shadows of trees covered with leaves are darker than the shadows of
those trees which have lost their leaves in proportion as the trees
covered with leaves are denser than those without leavesand thus
my meaning is proved
the definition of the blue colour of the atmosphere explains why the
landscape is bluer in the summer than in the winter
462
of painting in a landscape
if the slope of a hill comes between the eye and the horizon
sloping towards the eye while the eye is opposite the middle of the
height of this slope then that hill will increase in darkness
throughout its length this is proved by the 7th of this which says
that a tree looks darkest when it is seen from below the
proposition is verified since this hill will on its upper half
show all its trees as much from the side which is lighted by the
light of the sky as from that which is in shade from the darkness
of the earth whence it must result that these trees are of a medium
darkness and from this middle spot towards the base of the hill
these trees will be lighter by degrees by the converse of the 7th
and by the said 7th for trees so placed the nearer they are to the
summit of the hill the darker they necessarily become but this
darkness is not in proportion to the distance by the 8th of this
which says that object shows darkest which is seen in the
clearest atmosphere and by the 10th that shows darkest which
stands out against a lighter background
footnote the quotation in this passage again cannot be verified
463
of landscapes
the colours of the shadows in mountains at a great distance take a
most lovely blue much purer than their illuminated portions and
from this it follows that when the rock of a mountain is reddish the
illuminated portions are violet  and the more they are lighted
the more they display their proper colour
464
a place is most luminous when it is most remote from mountains
on the treatment of light for views of towns 465469
465
of light and shadow in a town
when the sun is in the east and the eye is above the centre of a
town the eye will see the southern part of the town with its roofs
half in shade and half in light and the same towards the north the
eastern side will be all in shadow and the western will be all in
light
466
of the houses of a town in which the divisions between the houses
may be distinguished by the light which fall on the mist at the
bottom if the eye is above the houses the light seen in the space
that is between one house and the next sinks by degrees into thicker
mist and yet being less transparent it appears whiter and if the
houses are some higher than the others since the true colour is
always more discernible through the thinner atmosphere the houses
will look darker in proportion as they are higher up let n o p q
represent the various density of the atmosphere thick with moisture
a being the eye the house b c will look lightest at the bottom
because it is in a thicker atmosphere the lines c d f will appear
equally light for although f is more distant than c it is
raised into a thinner atmosphere if the houses b e are of the
same height because they cross a brightness which is varied by
mist but this is only because the line of the eye which starts from
above ends by piercing a lower and denser atmosphere at d than at
b thus the line a f is lower at f than at c and the house
f will be seen darker at e from the line e k as far as m
than the tops of the houses standing in front of it
467
of towns or other buildings seen in the evening or the morning
through the mist
of buildings seen at a great distance in the evening or the morning
as in mist or dense atmosphere only those portions are seen in
brightness which are lighted up by the sun which is near the
horizon and those portions which are not lighted up by the sun
remain almost of the same colour and medium tone as the mist
why objects which are high up and at a distance are darker than the
lower ones even if the mist is uniformly dense
of objects standing in a mist or other dense atmosphere whether
from vapour or smoke or distance those will be most visible which
are the highest and among objects of equal height that will be the
darkest strongest which has for background the deepest mist thus
the eye h looking at a b c towers of equal height one with
another sees c the top of the first tower at r at two degrees
of depth in the mist and sees the height of the middle tower b
through one single degree of mist therefore the top of the tower
c appears stronger than the top of the tower b c
468
of the smoke of a town
smoke is seen better and more distinctly on the eastern side than on
the western when the sun is in the east and this arises from two
causes the first is that the sun with its rays shines through the
particles of the smoke and lights them up and makes them visible
the second is that the roofs of the houses seen in the east at this
time are in shadow because their obliquity does not allow of their
being illuminated by the sun and the same thing occurs with dust
and both one and the other look the lighter in proportion as they
are denser and they are densest towards the middle
469
of smoke and dust
if the sun is in the east the smoke of cities will not be visible in
the west because on that side it is not seen penetrated by the
solar rays nor on a dark background since the roofs of the houses
turn the same side to the eye as they turn towards the sun and on
this light background the smoke is not very visible
but dust under the same aspect will look darker than smoke being
of denser material than smoke which is moist
the effect of wind on trees 470473
470
of representing wind
in representing wind besides the bending of the boughs and the
reversing of their leaves towards the quarter whence the wind comes
you should also represent them amid clouds of fine dust mingled with
the troubled air
471
describe landscapes with the wind and the water and the setting
and rising of the sun
the wind
all the leaves which hung towards the earth by the bending of the
shoots with their branches are turned up side down by the gusts of
wind and here their perspective is reversed for if the tree is
between you and the quarter of the wind the leaves which are
towards you remain in their natural aspect while those on the
opposite side which ought to have their points in a contrary
direction have by being turned over their points turned towards
you
472
trees struck by the force of the wind bend to the side towards which
the wind is blowing and the wind being past they bend in the
contrary direction that is in reverse motion
473
that portion of a tree which is farthest from the force which
strikes it is the most injured by the blow because it bears most
strain thus nature has foreseen this case by thickening them in
that part where they can be most hurt and most in such trees as
grow to great heights as pines and the like footnote compare the
sketch drawn with a pen and washed with indian ink on pl xl no 1

475
the shadows in clouds are lighter in proportion as they are nearer
to the horizon
footnote the drawing belonging to this was in black chalk and is
totally effaced
476
when clouds come between the sun and the eye all the upper edges of
their round forms are light and towards the middle they are dark
and this happens because towards the top these edges have the sun
above them while you are below them and the same thing happens with
the position of the branches of trees and again the clouds like
the trees being somewhat transparent are lighted up in part and
at the edges they show thinner
but when the eye is between the cloud and the sun the cloud has
the contrary effect to the former for the edges of its mass are
dark and it is light towards the middle and this happens because
you see the same side as faces the sun and because the edges have
some transparency and reveal to the eye that portion which is hidden
beyond them and which as it does not catch the sunlight like that
portion turned towards it is necessarily somewhat darker again it
may be that you see the details of these rounded masses from the
lower side while the sun shines on the upper side and as they are
not so situated as to reflect the light of the sun as in the first
instance they remain dark
the black clouds which are often seen higher up than those which are
illuminated by the sun are shaded by other clouds lying between
them and the sun
again the rounded forms of the clouds that face the sun show their
edges dark because they lie against the light background and to see
that this is true you may look at the top of any cloud that is
wholly light because it lies against the blue of the atmosphere
which is darker than the cloud
footnote a drawing in red chalk from the windsor collection see
pl xxix representing a landscape with stormclouds may serve to
illustrate this section as well as the following one
477
of clouds smoke and dust and the flames of a furnace or of a
burning kiln
the clouds do not show their rounded forms excepting on the sides
which face the sun on the others the roundness is imperceptible
because they are in the shade footnote the text of this chapter

4 and 5 is the note rossore daria inverso lorizonteof the
redness of the atmosphere near the horizon the sketches on the
lower portion of the page will be spoken of in no 668
if the sun is in the east and the clouds in the west the eye placed
between the sun and the clouds sees the edges of the rounded forms
composing these clouds as dark and the portions which are
surrounded by this dark edge are light and this occurs because
the edges of the rounded forms of these clouds are turned towards
the upper or lateral sky which is reflected in them
both the cloud and the tree display no roundness at all on their
shaded side
on images reflected in water

painters often deceive themselves by representing water in which
they make the water reflect the objects seen by the man but the
water reflects the object from one side and the man sees it from the
other and it often happens that the painter sees an object from
below and thus one and the same object is seen from hind part
before and upside down because the water shows the image of the
object in one way and the eye sees it in another
of rainbows and rain 479 480
479
the colours in the middle of the rainbow mingle together
the bow in itself is not in the rain nor in the eye that sees it
though it is generated by the rain the sun and the eye the
rainbow is always seen by the eye that is between the rain and the
body of the sun hence if the sun is in the east and the rain is in
the west it will appear on the rain in the west
480
when the air is condensed into rain it would produce a vacuum if the
rest of the air did not prevent this by filling its place as it
does with a violent rush and this is the wind which rises in the
summer time accompanied by heavy rain
of flower seeds
481
all the flowers which turn towards the sun perfect their seeds but
not the others that is to say those which get only the reflection
of the sun
ix
the practice of painting
it is hardly necessary to offer any excuses for the division
carried out in the arrangement of the text into practical
suggestions and theoretical enquiries it was evidently intended by
leonardo himself as we conclude from incidental remarks in the mss
for instance no 110 the fact that this arrangement was never
carried out either in the old ms copies or in any edition since is
easily accounted for by the general disorder which results from the
provisional distribution of the various chapters in the old copies
we have every reason to believe that the earliest copyists in
distributing the materials collected by them did not in the least
consider the order in which the original mslay before them
it is evident that almost all the chapters which refer to the
calling and life of the painterand which are here brought together
in the first section nos 482508may be referred to two
distinct periods in leonardos life most of them can be dated as
belonging to the year 1492 or to 1515 at about this later time
leonardo may have formed the project of completing his libro della
pittura after an interval of some years as it would seem during
which his interest in the subject had fallen somewhat into the
background
in the second section which treats first of the artists studio
the construction of a suitable window forms the object of careful
investigations the special importance attached to this by leonardo
is sufficiently obvious his theory of the incidence of light which
was fully discussed in a former part of this work was to him by no
means of mere abstract value but being deduced as he says from
experience or experiment was required to prove its utility in
practice connected with this we find suggestions for the choice of
a light with practical hints as to sketching a picture and some
other precepts of a practical character which must come under
consideration in the course of completing the painting in all this
i have followed the same principle of arrangement in the text as was
carried out in the theory of painting thus the suggestions for the
perspective of a picture nos 536569 are followed by the
theory of light and shade for the practical method of optics nos
548566 and this by the practical precepts or the treatment of
aerial perspective 567570
in the passage on portrait and figure painting the principles of
painting as applied to a bust and head are separated and placed
first since the advice to figure painters must have some connection
with the principles of the treatment of composition by which they
are followed
but this arrangement of the text made it seem advisable not to pick
out the practical precepts as to the representation of trees and
landscape from the close connection in which they were originally
placedunlike the rest of the practical preceptswith the theory
of this branch of the subject they must therefore be sought under
the section entitled botany for painters
as a supplement to the libro di pittura i have here added those
texts which treat of the painters materialsas chalk drawing
paper colours and their preparation of the management of oils and
varnishes in the appendix are some notes on chemical substances
possibly some of these if not all may have stood in connection
with the preparation of colours it is in the very nature of things
that leonardos incidental indications as to colours and the like
should be nowadays extremely obscure and could only be explained
by professional expertsby them even in but few instances it might
therefore have seemed advisable to reproduce exactly the original
text without offering any translation the rendering here given is
merely an attempt to suggest what leonardos meaning may have been
lomazzo tells us in his trattato dellarte della pittura scultura

questione se e piu nobile la pittura o la scultura dicendo che
quanto piu unarte porta seco fatica di corpo e sudore tanto piu e
vile e men pregiata but the existence of any book specially
written for lodovico il moro on the superiority of painting over
sculpture is perhaps mythical the various passages in praise of
painting as compared not merely with sculpture but with poetry are
scattered among mss of very different dates
besides the way in which the subject is discussed appears not to
support the supposition that these texts were prepared at a special
request of the duke

moral precepts for the student of painting
how to ascertain the dispositions for an artistic career
482
a warning concerning youths wishing to be painters
many are they who have a taste and love for drawing but no talent
and this will be discernible in boys who are not diligent and never
finish their drawings with shading
the course of instruction for an artist 483485
483
the youth should first learn perspective then the proportions of
objects then he may copy from some good master to accustom himself
to fine forms then from nature to confirm by practice the rules he
has learnt then see for a time the works of various masters then
get the habit of putting his art into practice and work
footnote the vatican copy and numerous abridgements all place this
chapter at the beginning of the trattato and in consequence
dufresne and all subsequent editors have done the same in the
vatican copy however all the general considerations on the relation
of painting to the other arts are placed first as introductory
484
of the order of learning to draw
first draw from drawings by good masters done from works of art and
from nature and not from memory then from plastic work with the
guidance of the drawing done from it and then from good natural
models and this you must put into practice
485
precepts for drawing
the artist ought first to exercise his hand by copying drawings from
the hand of a good master and having acquired that practice under
the criticism of his master he should next practise drawing objects
in relief of a good style following the rules which will presently
be given
the study of the antique 486 487
486
of drawing
which is best to draw from nature or from the antique and which is
more difficult to do outlines or light and shade
487
it is better to imitate copy the antique than modern work
footnote 486 487 these are the only two passages in which
leonardo alludes to the importance of antique art in the training of
an artist the question asked in no 486 remains unanswered by him
and it seems to me very doubtful whether the opinion stated in no
487 is to be regarded as a reply to it this opinion stands in the
ms in a connectionas will be explained later onwhich seems to
require us to limit its application to a single special case at any
rate we may suspect that when leonardo put the question he felt
some hesitation as to the answer among his very numerous drawings i
have not been able to find a single study from the antique though a
drawing in black chalk at windsor of a man on horseback pi
lxxiii may perhaps be a reminiscence of the statue of marcus
aurelius at rome it seems to me that the drapery in a pen and ink
drawing of a bust also at windsor has been borrowed from an
antique model pl xxx g g rossi has i believe correctly
interpreted leonardos feeling towards the antique in the following
note on this passage in manzis edition p 501 sappiamo dalla
storia che i valorosi artisti toscani delleta delloro dellarte
studiarono sugli antichi marmi raccolti dal magnifico lorenzo de

footnote
the necessity of anatomical knowledge 488 489
488
of painting
it is indispensable to a painter who would be thoroughly familiar
with the limbs in all the positions and actions of which they are
capable in the nude to know the anatomy of the sinews bones
muscles and tendons so that in their various movements and
exertions he may know which nerve or muscle is the cause of each
movement and show those only as prominent and thickened and not the
others all over the limb as many do who to seem great
draughtsmen draw their nude figures looking like wood devoid of
grace so that you would think you were looking at a sack of walnuts
rather than the human form or a bundle of radishes rather than the
muscles of figures
489
how it is necessary to a painter that he should know the intrinsic
forms structure of man
the painter who is familiar with the nature of the sinews muscles
and tendons will know very well in giving movement to a limb how
many and which sinews cause it and which muscle by swelling
causes the contraction of that sinew and which sinews expanded
into the thinnest cartilage surround and support the said muscle
thus he will variously and constantly demonstrate the different
muscles by means of the various attitudes of his figures and will
not do as many who in a variety of movements still display the
very same things modelling in the arms back breast and legs and
these things are not to be regarded as minor faults
how to acquire practice
490
of study and the order of study
i say that first you ought to learn the limbs and their mechanism
and having this knowledge their actions should come next according
to the circumstances in which they occur in man and thirdly to
compose subjects the studies for which should be taken from natural
actions and made from time to time as circumstances allow and pay
attention to them in the streets and piazze and fields and note
them down with a brief indication of the forms footnote 5 lines
57 explained by the lower portion of the sketch no 1 on pl xxxi
thus for a head make an o and for an arm a straight or a bent line
and the same for the legs and the body footnote 7 lines 57
explained by the lower portion of the sketch no 1 on pl xxxi and
when you return home work out these notes in a complete form the
adversary says that to acquire practice and do a great deal of work
it is better that the first period of study should be employed in
drawing various compositions done on paper or on walls by divers
masters and that in this way practice is rapidly gained and good
methods to which i reply that the method will be good if it is
based on works of good composition and by skilled masters but since
such masters are so rare that there are but few of them to be found
it is a surer way to go to natural objects than to those which are
imitated from nature with great deterioration and so form bad
methods for he who can go to the fountain does not go to the
waterjar

malerbuck des l da vinci p 89 his reading however varies
slightly from mine
industry and thoroughness the first conditions 491493
491
what rules should be given to boys learning to paint
we know for certain that sight is one of the most rapid actions we
can perform in an instant we see an infinite number of forms still
we only take in thoroughly one object at a time supposing that you
reader were to glance rapidly at the whole of this written page
you would instantly perceive that it was covered with various
letters but you could not in the time recognise what the letters
were nor what they were meant to tell hence you would need to see
them word by word line by line to be able to understand the
letters again if you wish to go to the top of a building you must
go up step by step otherwise it will be impossible that you should
reach the top thus i say to you whom nature prompts to pursue this
art if you wish to have a sound knowledge of the forms of objects
begin with the details of them and do not go on to the second
step till you have the first well fixed in memory and in practice
and if you do otherwise you will throw away your time or certainly
greatly prolong your studies and remember to acquire diligence
rather than rapidity
492
how that diligence accuracy should first be learnt rather than
rapid execution
if you who draw desire to study well and to good purpose always
go slowly to work in your drawing and discriminate in the lights
which have the highest degree of brightness and to what extent and
likewise in the shadows which are those that are darker than the
others and in what way they intermingle then their masses and the
relative proportions of one to the other and note in their
outlines which way they tend and which part of the lines is curved
to one side or the other and where they are more or less
conspicuous and consequently broad or fine and finally that your
light and shade blend without strokes and borders but looking like
smoke and when you have thus schooled your hand and your judgment
by such diligence you will acquire rapidity before you are aware
the artists private life and choice of company 493494
493
of the life of the painter in the country
a painter needs such mathematics as belong to painting and the
absence of all companions who are alienated from his studies his
brain must be easily impressed by the variety of objects which
successively come before him and also free from other cares
footnote 6 leonardo here seems to be speaking of his own method of
work as displayed in his mss and this passage explains at least in
part the peculiarities in their arrangement and if when
considering and defining one subject a second subject
intervenesas happens when an object occupies the mind then he
must decide which of these cases is the more difficult to work out
and follow that up until it becomes quite clear and then work out
the explanation of the other footnote 11 leonardo here seems to be
speaking of his own method of work as displayed in his mss and this
passage explains at least in part the peculiarities in their
arrangement and above all he must keep his mind as clear as the
surface of a mirror which assumes colours as various as those of
the different objects and his companions should be like him as to
their studies and if such cannot be found he should keep his
speculations to himself alone so that at last he will find no more
useful company than his own
footnote in the title line leonardo had originally written del
pictore filosofo the philosophical painter but he himself struck
outfilosofo compare in no 363 pictora notomista anatomical
painter the original text is partly reproduced on pl ci
494
of the life of the painter in his studio
to the end that wellbeing of the body may not injure that of the
mind the painter or draughtsman must remain solitary and
particularly when intent on those studies and reflections which will
constantly rise up before his eye giving materials to be well
stored in the memory while you are alone you are entirely your own
master and if you have one companion you are but half your own
and the less so in proportion to the indiscretion of his behaviour
and if you have many companions you will fall deeper into the same
trouble if you should say i will go my own way and withdraw
apart the better to study the forms of natural objects i tell
you you will not be able to help often listening to their chatter
and so since one cannot serve two masters you will badly fill the
part of a companion and carry out your studies of art even worse
and if you say i will withdraw so far that their words cannot
reach me and they cannot disturb me i can tell you that you will
be thought mad but you see you will at any rate be alone and if
you must have companions ship find it in your studio this may
assist you to have the advantages which arise from various
speculations all other company may be highly mischievous
the distribution of time for studying 495497
495
of whether it is better to draw with companions or not
i say and insist that drawing in company is much better than alone
for many reasons the first is that you would be ashamed to be seen
behindhand among the students and such shame will lead you to
careful study secondly a wholesome emulation will stimulate you to
be among those who are more praised than yourself and this praise
of others will spur you on another is that you can learn from the
drawings of others who do better than yourself and if you are
better than they you can profit by your contempt for their defects
while the praise of others will incite you to farther merits
footnote the contradiction by this passage of the foregoing
chapter is only apparent it is quite clear from the nature of the
reasoning which is here used to prove that it is more improving to
work with others than to work alone that the studies of pupils only
are under consideration here
496
of studying in the dark when you wake or in bed before you go to
sleep
i myself have proved it to be of no small use when in bed in the
dark to recall in fancy the external details of forms previously
studied or other noteworthy things conceived by subtle speculation
and this is certainly an admirable exercise and useful for
impressing things on the memory
497
of the time for studying selection of subjects
winter evenings ought to be employed by young students in looking
over the things prepared during the summer that is all the
drawings from the nude done in the summer should be brought together
and a choice made of the best studies of limbs and bodies among
them to apply in practice and commit to memory
of positions
after this in the following summer you should select some one who is
well grown and who has not been brought up in doublets and so may
not be of stiff carriage and make him go through a number of agile
and graceful actions and if his muscles do not show plainly within
the outlines of his limbs that does not matter at all it is enough
that you can see good attitudes and you can correct the drawing of
the limbs by those you studied in the winter
footnote an injunction to study in the evening occurs also in no
524
on the productive power of minor artists 498501
498
he is a poor disciple who does not excel his master
499
nor is the painter praiseworthy who does but one thing well as the
nude figure heads draperies animals landscapes or other such
details irrespective of other work for there can be no mind so
inept that after devoting itself to one single thing and doing it
constantly it should fail to do it well
footnote in manzis edition p 502 the painter g g bossi
indignantly remarks on this passage parla il vince in questo
luogo come se tutti gli artisti avessero quella sublimita dingegno
capace di abbracciare tutte le cose di cui era egli dotato and he
then mentions the case of claude lorrain but he overlooks the fact
that in leonardos time landscape painting made no pretensions to
independence but was reckoned among the details particulari
lines 3 4
500
that a painter is not admirable unless he is universal
some may distinctly assert that those persons are under a delusion
who call that painter a good master who can do nothing well but a
head or a figure certainly this is no great achievement after
studying one single thing for a lifetime who would not have
attained some perfection in it but since we know that painting
embraces and includes in itself every object produced by nature or
resulting from the fortuitous actions of men in short all that the
eye can see he seems to me but a poor master who can only do a
figure well for do you not perceive how many and various actions
are performed by men only how many different animals there are as
well as trees plants flowers with many mountainous regions and
plains springs and rivers cities with public and private
buildings machines too fit for the purposes of men divers
costumes decorations and arts and all these things ought to be
regarded as of equal importance and value by the man who can be
termed a good painter
501
of the miserable pretences made by those who falsely and unworthily
acquire the name of painters
now there is a certain race of painters who having studied but
little must need take as their standard of beauty mere gold and
azure and these with supreme conceit declare that they will not
give good work for miserable payment and that they could do as well
as any other if they were well paid but ye foolish folks cannot
such artists keep some good work and then say this is a costly
work and this more moderate and this is average work and show that
they can work at all prices
a caution against onesided study
502
how in important works a man should not trust entirely to his
memory without condescending to draw from nature
any master who should venture to boast that he could remember all
the forms and effects of nature would certainly appear to me to be
graced with extreme ignorance inasmuch as these effects are
infinite and our memory is not extensive enough to retain them
hence o painter beware lest the lust of gain should supplant in
you the dignity of art for the acquisition of glory is a much
greater thing than the glory of riches hence for these and other
reasons which might be given first strive in drawing to represent
your intention to the eye by expressive forms and the idea
originally formed in your imagination then go on taking out or
putting in until you have satisfied yourself then have living men
draped or nude as you may have purposed in your work and take care
that in dimensions and size as determined by perspective nothing
is left in the work which is not in harmony with reason and the
effects in nature and this will be the way to win honour in your
art
how to acquire universality 503506
503
of variety in the figures
the painter should aim at universality because there is a great
want of selfrespect in doing one thing well and another badly as
many do who study only the rules of measure and proportion in the
nude figure and do not seek after variety for a man may be well
proportioned or he may be fat and short or tall and thin or
medium and a painter who takes no account of these varieties always
makes his figures on one pattern so that they might all be taken for
brothers and this is a defect that demands stern reprehension
504
how something may be learnt everywhere
nature has beneficently provided that throughout the world you may
find something to imitate
505
of the means of acquiring universality
it is an easy matter to men to acquire universality for all
terrestrial animals resemble each other as to their limbs that is
in their muscles sinews and bones and they do not vary excepting
in length or in thickness as will be shown under anatomy but then
there are aquatic animals which are of great variety i will not try
to convince the painter that there is any rule for them for they are
of infinite variety and so is the insect tribe
506
painting
the mind of the painter must resemble a mirror which always takes
the colour of the object it reflects and is completely occupied by
the images of as many objects as are in front of it therefore you
must know oh painter that you cannot be a good one if you are not
the universal master of representing by your art every kind of form
produced by nature and this you will not know how to do if you do
not see them and retain them in your mind hence as you go through
the fields turn your attention to various objects and in turn
look now at this thing and now at that collecting a store of divers
facts selected and chosen from those of less value but do not do
like some painters who when they are wearied with exercising their
fancy dismiss their work from their thoughts and take exercise in
walking for relaxation but still keep fatigue in their mind which
though they see various objects around them does not apprehend
them but even when they meet friends or relations and are saluted
by them although they see and hear them take no more cognisance of
them than if they had met so much empty air
useful games and exercises 507 508
507
of games to be played by those who draw
when oh draughtsmen you desire to find relaxation in games you
should always practise such things as may be of use in your
profession by giving your eye good practice in judging accurately
of the breadth and length of objects thus to accustom your mind to
such things let one of you draw a straight line at random on a
wall and each of you taking a blade of grass or of straw in his
hand try to cut it to the length that the line drawn appears to him
to be standing at a distance of 10 braccia then each one may go up
to the line to measure the length he has judged it to be and he who
has come nearest with his measure to the length of the pattern is
the best man and the winner and shall receive the prize you have
settled beforehand again you should take forshortened measures
that is take a spear or any other cane or reed and fix on a point
at a certain distance and let each one estimate how many times he
judges that its length will go into that distance again who will
draw best a line one braccio long which shall be tested by a
thread and such games give occasion to good practice for the eye
which is of the first importance in painting
508
a way of developing and arousing the mind to various inventions
i cannot forbear to mention among these precepts a new device for
study which although it may seem but trivial and almost ludicrous
is nevertheless extremely useful in arousing the mind to various
inventions and this is when you look at a wall spotted with
stains or with a mixture of stones if you have to devise some
scene you may discover a resemblance to various landscapes
beautified with mountains rivers rocks trees plains wide
valleys and hills in varied arrangement or again you may see
battles and figures in action or strange faces and costumes and an
endless variety of objects which you could reduce to complete and
well drawn forms and these appear on such walls confusedly like
the sound of bells in whose jangle you may find any name or word you
choose to imagine

the windowopening is reduced to a minimum but only it would seem
in order to emphasize the advantage of walls constructed on the plan
there shown
512
of the painters window and its advantage
the painter who works from nature should have a window which he can
raise and lower the reason is that sometimes you will want to
finish a thing you are drawing close to the light
let a b c d be the chest on which the work may be raised or
lowered so that the work moves up and down and not the painter and
every evening you can let down the work and shut it up above so that
in the evening it may be in the fashion of a chest which when shut
up may serve the purpose of a bench

which light is best for drawing from nature whether high or low or
large or small or strong and broad or strong and small or broad
and weak or small and weak
footnote the question here put is unanswered in the original ms
514
of the quality of the light
a broad light high up and not too strong will render the details of
objects very agreeable
515
that the light for drawing from nature should be high up
the light for drawing from nature should come from the north in
order that it may not vary and if you have it from the south keep
the window screened with cloth so that with the sun shining the
whole day the light may not vary the height of the light should be
so arranged as that every object shall cast a shadow on the ground
of the same length as itself
516
the kind of light requisite for painting light and shade
an object will display the greatest difference of light and shade
when it is seen in the strongest light as by sunlight or at
night by the light of a fire but this should not be much used in
painting because the works remain crude and ungraceful
an object seen in a moderate light displays little difference in the
light and shade and this is the case towards evening or when the
day is cloudy and works then painted are tender and every kind of
face becomes graceful thus in every thing extremes are to be
avoided too much light gives crudeness too little prevents our
seeing the medium is best
of small lights
again lights cast from a small window give strong differences of
light and shade all the more if the room lighted by it be large
and this is not good for painting
517
painting
the luminous air which enters by passing through orifices in walls
into dark rooms will render the place less dark in proportion as the
opening cuts into the walls which surround and cover in the
pavement
518
of the quality of light
in proportion to the number of times that a b goes into c d will
it be more luminous than c d and similarly in proportion as the
point e goes into c d will it be more luminous than c d and
this light is useful for carvers of delicate work footnote 5 for
the same reason a window thus constructed would be convenient for an
illuminator or a miniature painter

portrait do it in dull weather or as evening falls making the
sitter stand with his back to one of the walls of the court yard
note in the streets as evening falls the faces of the men and
women and when the weather is dull what softness and delicacy you
may perceive in them hence oh painter have a court arranged with
the walls tinted black and a narrow roof projecting within the
walls it should be 10 braccia wide and 20 braccia long and 10
braccia high and covered with a linen awning or else paint a work
towards evening or when it is cloudy or misty and this is a perfect

to draw a nude figure from nature or any thing else hold in your
hand a plumbline to enable you to judge of the relative position
of objects
522
of drawing an object
when you draw take care to set up a principal line which you must
observe all throughout the object you are drawing every thing
should bear relation to the direction of this principal line
523
of a mode of drawing a place accurately
have a piece of glass as large as a half sheet of royal folio paper
and set thus firmly in front of your eyes that is between your eye
and the thing you want to draw then place yourself at a distance of
23 of a braccia from the glass fixing your head with a machine in
such a way that you cannot move it at all then shut or entirely
cover one eye and with a brush or red chalk draw upon the glass that
which you see beyond it then trace it on paper from the glass
afterwards transfer it onto good paper and paint it if you like
carefully attending to the arial perspective
how to learn to place your figures correctly
if you want to acquire a practice of good and correct attitudes for
your figures make a square frame or net and square it out with
thread place this between your eye and the nude model you are
drawing and draw these same squares on the paper on which you mean
to draw the figure but very delicately then place a pellet of wax
on a spot of the net which will serve as a fixed point which
whenever you look at your model must cover the pit of the throat
or if his back is turned it may cover one of the vertebrae of the
neck thus these threads will guide you as to each part of the body
which in any given attitude will be found below the pit of the
throat or the angles of the shoulders or the nipples or hips and
other parts of the body and the transverse lines of the net will
show you how much the figure is higher over the leg on which it is
posed than over the other and the same with the hips and the knees
and the feet but always fix the net perpendicularly so that all the
divisions that you see the model divided into by the net work
correspond with your drawing of the model on the net work you have
sketched the squares you draw may be as much smaller than those of
the net as you wish that your figure should be smaller than nature
afterwards remember when drawing figures to use the rule of the
corresponding proportions of the limbs as you have learnt it from
the frame and net this should be 3 braccia and a half high and 3
braccia wide 7 braccia distant from you and 1 braccio from the
model

round set a light close to it in such a position as that it shines
through the central hole then place any object or figure you please
so close to the wall that it touches it and draw the outline of the
shadow on the wall then fill in the shade and add the lights place

to draw a figure on a wall 12 braccia high which shall look 24
braccia high
if you wish to draw a figure or any other object to look 24 braccia
high you must do it in this way first on the surface m r draw
half the man you wish to represent then the other half then put on
the vault m n the rest of the figure spoken of above first set
out the vertical plane on the floor of a room of the same shape as
the wall with the coved part on which you are to paint your figure
then behind it draw a figure set out in profile of whatever size
you please and draw lines from it to the point f and as these
lines cut m n on the vertical plane so will the figure come on
the wall of which the vertical plane gives a likeness and you will
have all the relative heights and prominences of the figure and
the breadth or thickness which are on the upright wall m n are to
be drawn in their proper form since as the wall recedes the figure
will be foreshortened by itself but that part of the figure which
goes into the cove you must foreshorten as if it were standing
upright this diminution you must set out on a flat floor and there
must stand the figure which is to be transferred from the vertical
plane r nfootnote 17 che leverai dalla pariete r n the
letters refer to the larger sketch no 3 on pl xxxi in its real
size and reduce it once more on a vertical plane and this will be a
good method footnote 18 leonardo here says nothing as to how the
image foreshortened by perspective and thus produced on the vertical
plane is to be transferred to the wall but from what is said in
nos 525 and 523 we may conclude that he was familiar with the
process of casting the enlarged shadow of a squaring net on the
surface of a wall to guide him in drawing the figure

528
why are paintings seen more correctly in a mirror than out of it
529
how the mirror is the master and guide of painters
when you want to see if your picture corresponds throughout with the
objects you have drawn from nature take a mirror and look in that
at the reflection of the real things and compare the reflected
image with your picture and consider whether the subject of the two
images duly corresponds in both particularly studying the mirror
you should take the mirror for your guidethat is to say a flat
mirrorbecause on its surface the objects appear in many respects
as in a painting thus you see in a painting done on a flat
surface objects which appear in relief and in the mirroralso a
flat surfacethey look the same the picture has one plane surface
and the same with the mirror the picture is intangible in so far
as that which appears round and prominent cannot be grasped in the
hands and it is the same with the mirror and since you can see
that the mirror by means of outlines shadows and lights makes
objects appear in relief you who have in your colours far stronger
lights and shades than those in the mirror can certainly if you
compose your picture well make that also look like a natural scene
reflected in a large mirror
footnote i understand the concluding lines of this passage as
follows if you draw the upper half a figure on a large sheet of
paper laid out on the floor of a room sala be piana to the same
scale con le sue vere grosseze as the lower half already drawn
upon the wall lines 10 11you must then reduce them on a pariete
di rilievo a curved vertical plane which serves as a model to
reproduce the form of the vault
530
of judging your own pictures
we know very well that errors are better recognised in the works of
others than in our own and that often while reproving little
faults in others you may ignore great ones in yourself to avoid
such ignorance in the first place make yourself a master of
perspective then acquire perfect knowledge of the proportions of
men and other animals and also study good architecture that is so
far as concerns the forms of buildings and other objects which are
on the face of the earth these forms are infinite and the better
you know them the more admirable will your work be and in cases
where you lack experience do not shrink from drawing them from
nature but to carry out my promise above in the titlei say
that when you paint you should have a flat mirror and often look at
your work as reflected in it when you will see it reversed and it
will appear to you like some other painters work so you will be
better able to judge of its faults than in any other way again it
is well that you should often leave off work and take a little
relaxation because when you come back to it you are a better
judge for sitting too close at work may greatly deceive you again
it is good to retire to a distance because the work looks smaller
and your eye takes in more of it at a glance and sees more easily
the discords or disproportion in the limbs and colours of the
objects
on the management of works 531 532
531
of a method of learning well by heart
when you want to know a thing you have studied in your memory
proceed in this way when you have drawn the same thing so many
times that you think you know it by heart test it by drawing it
without the model but have the model traced on flat thin glass and
lay this on the drawing you have made without the model and note
carefully where the tracing does not coincide with your drawing and
where you find you have gone wrong and bear in mind not to repeat
the same mistakes then return to the model and draw the part in
which you were wrong again and again till you have it well in your
mind if you have no flat glass for tracing on take some very thin
kidtskin parchment well oiled and dried and when you have used it
for one drawing you can wash it clean with a sponge and make a
second
532
that a painter ought to be curious to hear the opinions of every one
on his work
certainly while a man is painting he ought not to shrink from
hearing every opinion for we know very well that a man though he
may not be a painter is familiar with the forms of other men and
very capable of judging whether they are hump backed or have one
shoulder higher or lower than the other or too big a mouth or nose
and other defects and as we know that men are competent to judge
of the works of nature how much more ought we to admit that they
can judge of our errors since you know how much a man may be
deceived in his own work and if you are not conscious of this in
yourself study it in others and profit by their faults therefore be
curious to hear with patience the opinions of others consider and
weigh well whether those who find fault have ground or not for
blame and if so amend but if not make as though you had not
heard or if he should be a man you esteem show him by argument the
cause of his mistake
on the limitations of painting 533535
533
how in small objects errors are less evident than in large ones
in objects of minute size the extent of error is not so perceptible
as in large ones and the reason is that if this small object is a
representation of a man or of some other animal from the immense
diminution the details cannot be worked out by the artist with the
finish that is requisite hence it is not actually complete and
not being complete its faults cannot be determined for instance
look at a man at a distance of 300 braccia and judge attentively
whether he be handsome or ugly or very remarkable or of ordinary
appearance you will find that with the utmost effort you cannot
persuade yourself to decide and the reason is that at such a
distance the man is so much diminished that the character of the
details cannot be determined and if you wish to see how much this
man is diminished by distance hold one of your fingers at a spans
distance from your eye and raise or lower it till the top joint
touches the feet of the figure you are looking at and you will see
an incredible reduction for this reason we often doubt as to the
person of a friend at a distance
534
why a painting can never appear detached as natural objects do
painters often fall into despair of imitating nature when they see
their pictures fail in that relief and vividness which objects have
that are seen in a mirror while they allege that they have colours
which for brightness or depth far exceed the strength of light and
shade in the reflections in the mirror thus displaying their own
ignorance rather than the real cause because they do not know it
it is impossible that painted objects should appear in such relief
as to resemble those reflected in the mirror although both are seen
on a flat surface unless they are seen with only one eye and the
reason is that two eyes see one object behind another as a and b
see m and n m cannot exactly occupy the space of n
because the base of the visual lines is so broad that the second
body is seen beyond the first but if you close one eye as at s
the body f will conceal r because the line of sight proceeds
from a single point and makes its base in the first body whence the
second of the same size can never be seen
footnote this passage contains the solution of the problem
proposed in no 29 lines 1014 leonardo was evidently familiar
with the law of optics on which the construction of the stereoscope
depends compare e von brucke bruchstucke aus der theorie der

535
why of two objects of equal size a painted one will look larger than
a solid one
the reason of this is not so easy to demonstrate as many others
still i will endeavour to accomplish it if not wholly at any rate
in part the perspective of diminution demonstrates by reason that
objects diminish in proportion as they are farther from the eye and
this reasoning is confirmed by experience hence the lines of sight
that extend between the object and the eye when they are directed
to the surface of a painting are all intersected at uniform limits
while those lines which are directed towards a piece of sculpture
are intersected at various limits and are of various lengths the
lines which are longest extend to a more remote limb than the others
and therefore that limb looks smaller as there are numerous lines
each longer than the otherssince there are numerous parts each
more remote than the others and these being farther off
necessarily appear smaller and by appearing smaller it follows that
their diminution makes the whole mass of the object look smaller
but this does not occur in painting since the lines of sight all
end at the same distance there can be no diminution hence the parts
not being diminished the whole object is undiminished and for this
reason painting does not diminish as a piece of sculpture does
on the choice of a position 536537
536
how high the point of sight should be placed
the point of sight must be at the level of the eye of an ordinary
man and the farthest limit of the plain where it touches the sky
must be placed at the level of that line where the earth and sky
meet excepting mountains which are independent of it
537
of the way to draw figures for historical pictures
the painter must always study on the wall on which he is to picture
a story the height of the position where he wishes to arrange his
figures and when drawing his studies for them from nature he must
place himself with his eye as much below the object he is drawing
as in the picture it will have to be above the eye of the
spectator otherwise the work will look wrong
the apparent size of figures in a picture 538539
538
of placing a figure in the foreground of a historical picture
you must make the foremost figure in the picture less than the size
of nature in proportion to the number of braccia at which you place
it from the front line and make the others in proportion by the
above rule
539
perspective
you are asked o painter why the figures you draw on a small scale
according to the laws of perspective do not appearnotwithstanding
the demonstration of distanceas large as real onestheir height
being the same as in those painted on the wall
and why painted objects seen at a small distance appear larger
than the real ones
the right position of the artist when painting and of the
spectator 540547
540
of painting
when you draw from nature stand at a distance of 3 times the height
of the object you wish to draw
541
of drawing from relief
in drawing from the round the draughtsman should so place himself
that the eye of the figure he is drawing is on a level with his own
this should be done with any head he may have to represent from
nature because without exception the figures or persons you meet
in the streets have their eyes on the same level as your own and if
you place them higher or lower you will see that your drawing will
not be true
542
why groups of figures one above another are to be avoided
the universal practice which painters adopt on the walls of chapels
is greatly and reasonably to be condemned inasmuch as they
represent one historical subject on one level with a landscape and
buildings and then go up a step and paint another varying the
point of sight and then a third and a fourth in such a way as
that on one wall there are 4 points of sight which is supreme folly
in such painters we know that the point of sight is opposite the
eye of the spectator of the scene and if you would have me tell
you how to represent the life of a saint divided into several
pictures on one and the same wall i answer that you must set out
the foreground with its point of sight on a level with the eye of
the spectator of the scene and upon this plane represent the more
important part of the story large and then diminishing by degrees
the figures and the buildings on various hills and open spaces you
can represent all the events of the history and on the remainder of
the wall up to the top put trees large as compared with the
figures or angels if they are appropriate to the story or birds or
clouds or similar objects otherwise do not trouble yourself with it
for your whole work will be wrong
543
a picture of objects in perspective will look more lifelike when
seen from the point from which the objects were drawn
if you want to represent an object near to you which is to have the
effect of nature it is impossible that your perspective should not
look wrong with every false relation and disagreement of proportion
that can be imagined in a wretched work unless the spectator when
he looks at it has his eye at the very distance and height and
direction where the eye or the point of sight was placed in doing
this perspective hence it would be necessary to make a window or
rather a hole of the size of your face through which you can look
at the work and if you do this beyond all doubt your work if it
is correct as to light and shade will have the effect of nature
nay you will hardly persuade yourself that those objects are
painted otherwise do not trouble yourself about it unless indeed
you make your view at least 20 times as far off as the greatest
width or height of the objects represented and this will satisfy
any spectator placed anywhere opposite to the picture
if you want the proof briefly shown take a piece of wood in the
form of a little column eight times as high as it is thick like a
column without any plinth or capital then mark off on a flat wall
40 equal spaces equal to its width so that between them they make
40 columns resembling your little column you then must fix
opposite the centre space and at 4 braccia from the wall a thin
strip of iron with a small round hole in the middle about as large
as a big pearl close to this hole place a light touching it then
place your column against each mark on the wall and draw the outline
of its shadow afterwards shade it and look through the hole in the
iron plate
footnote in the original there is a wide space between lines 3 and
4 in which we find two sketches not belonging to the text it is
unnecessary to give prominence to the points in which my reading
differs from that of m ravaisson or to justify myself since they
are all of secondary importance and can also be immediately verified
from the photograph facsimile in his edition
544
a diminished object should be seen from the same distance height
and direction as the point of sight of your eye or else your
knowledge will produce no good effect
and if you will not or cannot act on this principlebecause as
the plane on which you paint is to be seen by several persons you
would need several points of sight which would make it look
discordant and wrongplace yourself at a distance of at least 10
times the size of the objects
the lesser fault you can fall into then will be that of
representing all the objects in the foreground of their proper size
and on whichever side you are standing the objects thus seen will
diminish themselves while the spaces between them will have no
definite ratio for if you place yourself in the middle of a
straight row of objects and look at several columns arranged in a
line you will see beyond a few columns separated by intervals that
the columns touch and beyond where they touch they cover each
other till the last column projects but very little beyond the last
but one thus the spaces between the columns are by degrees entirely
lost so if your method of perspective is good it will produce the
same effect this effect results from standing near the line in
which the columns are placed this method is not satisfactory unless
the objects seen are viewed from a small hole in the middle of
which is your point of sight but if you proceed thus your work will
be perfect and will deceive the beholder who will see the columns
as they are here figured
here the eye is in the middle at the point a and near to the
columns
footnote the diagram which stands above this chapter in the
original with the note belonging to it a b e la ripruova a b

545
if you cannot arrange that those who look at your work should stand
at one particular point when constructing your work stand back
until your eye is at least 20 times as far off as the greatest
height and width of your work this will make so little difference
when the eye of the spectator moves that it will be hardly
appreciable and it will look very good
if the point of sight is at t you would make the figures on the
circle d b e all of one size as each of them bears the same
relation to the point t but consider the diagram given below and
you will see that this is wrong and why i shall make b smaller
than d e footnote 8 the second diagram of this chapter stands in
the original between lines 8 and 9
it is easy to understand that if 2 objects equal to each other are
placed side by side the one at 3 braccia distance looks smaller than
that placed at 2 braccia this however is rather theoretical than
for practice because you stand close by footnote 11 instead of
se preso sie presso m ravaisson reads sempre se which
gives rise to the unmeaning rendering parceque toujours 
all the objects in the foreground whether large or small are to be
drawn of their proper size and if you see them from a distance they
will appear just as they ought and if you see them close they will
diminish of themselves

plan on which you work out the perspective of the objects seen is of
the same form as the wall on which the work is to be executed

of painting
the size of the figures represented ought to show you the distance
they are seen from if you see a figure as large as nature you know
it appears to be close to the eye
547
where a spectator should stand to look at a picture
supposing a b to be the picture and d to be the light i say
that if you place yourself between c and e you will not
understand the picture well and particularly if it is done in oils
or still more if it is varnished because it will be lustrous and
somewhat of the nature of a mirror and for this reason the nearer
you go towards the point c the less you will see because the
rays of light falling from the window on the picture are reflected
to that point but if you place yourself between e and d you
will get a good view of it and the more so as you approach the
point d because that spot is least exposed to these reflected
rays of light
iii
the practical methods of light and shade and aerial perspective
gradations of light and shade
548
of painting of the darkness of the shadows or i may say the
brightness of the lights
although practical painters attribute to all shaded objectstrees
fields hair beards and skinfour degrees of darkness in each
colour they use that is to say first a dark foundation secondly a
spot of colour somewhat resembling the form of the details thirdly
a somewhat brighter and more defined portion fourthly the lights
which are more conspicuous than other parts of the figure still to
me it appears that these gradations are infinite upon a continuous
surface which is in itself infinitely divisible and i prove it
thusfootnote 7 see pl xxxi no 1 the two upper sketches
let a g be a continuous surface and let d be the light which
illuminates it i sayby the 4th proposition which says that that
side of an illuminated body is most highly lighted which is nearest
to the source of lightthat therefore g must be darker than c
in proportion as the line d g is longer than the line d c and
consequently that these gradations of lightor rather of shadow
are not 4 only but may be conceived of as infinite because c d
is a continuous surface and every continuous surface is infinitely
divisible hence the varieties in the length of lines extending
between the light and the illuminated object are infinite and the
proportion of the light will be the same as that of the length of
the lines between them extending from the centre of the luminous
body to the surface of the illuminated object
on the choice of light for a picture 549554
549
how the painter must place himself with reference to the light to
give the effect of relief
let a b be the window m the point of light i say that on
whichever side the painter places himself he will be well placed if
only his eye is between the shaded and the illuminated portions of
the object he is drawing and this place you will find by putting
yourself between the point m and the division between the shadow
and the light on the object to be drawn
550
that shadows cast by a particular light should be avoided because
they are equally strong at the ends and at the beginning
the shadows cast by the sun or any other particular light have not a
pleasing effect on the body to which they belong because the parts
remain confuse being divided by distinct outlines of light and
shade and the shadows are of equal strength at the end and at the
beginning
551
how light should be thrown upon figures
the light must be arranged in accordance with the natural conditions
under which you wish to represent your figures that is if you
represent them in the sunshine make the shadows dark with large
spaces of light and mark their shadows and those of all the
surrounding objects strongly on the ground and if you represent
them as in dull weather give little difference of light and shade
without any shadows at their feet if you represent them as within
doors make a strong difference between the lights and shadows with
shadows on the ground if the window is screened and the walls
white there will be little difference of light if it is lighted by
firelight make the high lights ruddy and strong and the shadows
dark and those cast on the walls and on the floor will be clearly
defined and the farther they are from the body the broader and
longer will they be if the light is partly from the fire and partly
from the outer day that of day will be the stronger and that of the
fire almost as red as fire itself above all see that the figures
you paint are broadly lighted and from above that is to say all
living persons that you paint for you will see that all the people
you meet out in the street are lighted from above and you must know
that if you saw your most intimate friend with a light on his face
from below you would find it difficult to recognise him
552
of helping the apparent relief of a picture by giving it artificial
light and shade
to increase relief of a picture you may place between your figure
and the solid object on which its shadow falls a line of bright
light dividing the figure from the object in shadow and on the
same object you shall represent two light parts which will surround
the shadow cast upon the wall by the figure placed opposite 6 and
do this frequently with the limbs which you wish should stand out
somewhat from the body they belong to particularly when the arms
cross the front of the breast show between the shadow cast by the
arms on the breast and the shadow on the arms themselves a little
light seeming to fall through a space between the breast and the
arms and the more you wish the arm to look detached from the breast
the broader you must make the light always contrive also to arrange
the figures against the background in such a way as that the parts
in shadow are against a light background and the illuminated
portions against a dark background
footnote 6 compare the two diagrams under no 565
553
of situation
remember to note the situation of your figures for the light and
shade will be one thing if the object is in a dark place with a
particular light and another thing if it is in a light place with
direct sunlight one thing in a dark place with a diffused evening
light or a cloudy sky and another in the diffused light of the
atmosphere lighted by the sun
554
of the judgment to be made of a painters work
first you must consider whether the figures have the relief required
by their situation and the light which illuminates them for the
shadows should not be the same at the extreme ends of the
composition as in the middle because it is one thing when figures
are surrounded by shadows and another when they have shadows only on
one side those which are in the middle of the picture are
surrounded by shadows because they are shaded by the figures which
stand between them and the light and those are lighted on one side
only which stand between the principal group and the light because
where they do not look towards the light they face the group and the
darkness of the group is thrown on them and where they do not face
the group they face the brilliant light and it is their own darkness
shadowing them which appears there
in the second place observe the distribution or arrangement of
figures and whether they are distributed appropriately to the
circumstances of the story thirdly whether the figures are
actively intent on their particular business
555
of the treatment of the lights
first give a general shadow to the whole of that extended part which
is away from the light then put in the half shadows and the strong
shadows comparing them with each other and in the same way give
the extended light in half tint afterwards adding the half lights
and the high lights likewise comparing them together
the distribution of light and shade 556559
556
of shadows on bodies
when you represent the dark shadows in bodies in light and shade
always show the cause of the shadow and the same with reflections
because the dark shadows are produced by dark objects and the
reflections by objects only moderately lighted that is with
diminished light and there is the same proportion between the
highly lighted part of a body and the part lighted by a reflection
as between the origin of the lights on the body and the origin of
the reflections
557
of lights and shadows
i must remind you to take care that every portion of a body and
every smallest detail which is ever so little in relief must be
given its proper importance as to light and shade
558
of the way to make the shadow on figures correspond to the light and
to the colour of the body
when you draw a figure and you wish to see whether the shadow is the
proper complement to the light and neither redder nor yellower than
is the nature of the colour you wish to represent in shade proceed
thus cast a shadow with your finger on the illuminated portion and
if the accidental shadow that you have made is like the natural
shadow cast by your finger on your work well and good and by
putting your finger nearer or farther off you can make darker or
lighter shadows which you must compare with your own
559
of surrounding bodies by various forms of shadow
take care that the shadows cast upon the surface of the bodies by
different objects must undulate according to the various curves of
the limbs which cast the shadows and of the objects on which they
are cast
the juxtaposition of light and shade 560 561
560
on painting
the comparison of the various qualities of shadows and lights not
infrequently seems ambiguous and confused to the painter who desires
to imitate and copy the objects he sees the reason is this if you
see a white drapery side by side with a black one that part of the
white drapery which lies against the black one will certainly look
much whiter than the part which lies against something whiter than
itself footnote it is evident from this that so early as in 1492
leonardos writing in perspective was so far advanced that he could
quote his own statementsas bearing on this subject compare what
is said in no 280 and the reason of this is shown in my book on
perspective

of shadows

or deeper and where it is more or less indistinct towards the light
and above all in painting youthful figures i remind you not to
make the shadow end like a stone because flesh has a certain
transparency as may be seen by looking at a hand held between the
eye and the sun which shines through it ruddy and bright place the
most highly coloured part between the light and shadow and to see
what shadow tint is needed on the flesh cast a shadow on it with
your finger and according as you wish to see it lighter or darker
hold your finger nearer to or farther from your picture and copy
that shadow
on the lighting of the background 562565
562
of the backgrounds for painted figures
the ground which surrounds the forms of any object you paint should
be darker than the high lights of those figures and lighter than
their shadowed part c
563
of the background that the painter should adopt in his works
since experience shows us that all bodies are surrounded by light
and shade it is necessary that you o painter should so arrange
that the side which is in light shall terminate against a dark body
and likewise that the shadow side shall terminate against a light
body and by following this rule you will add greatly to the
relief of your figures
564
a most important part of painting consists in the backgrounds of the
objects represented against these backgrounds the outlines of
those natural objects which are convex are always visible and also
the forms of these bodies against the background even though the
colours of the bodies should be the same as that of the background
this is caused by the convex edges of the objects not being
illuminated in the same way as by the same light the background is
illuminated since these edges will often be lighter or darker than
the background but if the edge is of the same colour as the
background beyond a doubt it will in that part of the picture
interfere with your perception of the outline and such a choice in
a picture ought to be rejected by the judgment of good painters
inasmuch as the purpose of the painter is to make his figures appear
detached from the background while in the case here described the
contrary occurs not only in the picture but in the objects
themselves
565
that you ought when representing objects above the eye and on one
sideif you wish them to look detached from the wallto show
between the shadow on the object and the shadow it casts a middle
light so that the body will appear to stand away from the wall
on the lighting of white objects
566
how white bodies should be represented
if you are representing a white body let it be surrounded by ample
space because as white has no colour of its own it is tinged and
altered in some degree by the colour of the objects surrounding it
if you see a woman dressed in white in the midst of a landscape
that side which is towards the sun is bright in colour so much so
that in some portions it will dazzle the eyes like the sun itself
and the side which is towards the atmosphereluminous through
being interwoven with the suns rays and penetrated by themsince
the atmosphere itself is blue that side of the womans figure will
appear steeped in blue if the surface of the ground about her be
meadows and if she be standing between a field lighted up by the sun
and the sun itself you will see every portion of those folds which
are towards the meadow tinged by the reflected rays with the colour
of that meadow thus the white is transmuted into the colours of the
luminous and of the nonluminous objects near it
the methods of aerial 567570
567
why faces seen at a distance look dark
we see quite plainly that all the images of visible objects that lie
before us whether large or small reach our sense by the minute
aperture of the eye and if through so small a passage the image
can pass of the vast extent of sky and earth the face of a
manbeing by comparison with such large images almost nothing by
reason of the distance which diminishes itfills up so little of
the eye that it is indistinguishable having also to be
transmitted from the surface to the sense through a dark medium
that is to say the crystalline lens which looks dark this image
not being strong in colour becomes affected by this darkness on its
passage and on reaching the sense it appears dark no other reason
can in any way be assigned if the point in the eye is black it is
because it is full of a transparent humour as clear as air and acts
like a perforation in a board on looking into it it appears dark
and the objects seen through the bright air and a dark one become
confused in this darkness
why a man seen at a certain distance is not recognisable
the perspective of diminution shows us that the farther away an
object is the smaller it looks if you look at a man at a distance
from you of an arrows flight and hold the eye of a small needle
close to your own eye you can see through it several men whose
images are transmitted to the eye and will all be comprised within
the size of the needles eye hence if the man who is at the
distance of an arrows flight can send his whole image to your eye
occupying only a small space in the needles eye how can you
expect in so small a figure to distinguish or see the nose or
mouth or any detail of his person and not seeing these you cannot
recognise the man since these features which he does not show are
what give men different aspects
568
the reason why small figures should not be made finished
i say that the reason that objects appear diminished in size is
because they are remote from the eye this being the case it is
evident that there must be a great extent of atmosphere between the
eye and the objects and this air interferes with the distinctness
of the forms of the object hence the minute details of these
objects will be indistinguishable and unrecognisable therefore o
painter make your smaller figures merely indicated and not highly
finished otherwise you will produce effects the opposite to nature
your supreme guide the object is small by reason of the great
distance between it and the eye this great distance is filled with
air that mass of air forms a dense body which intervenes and
prevents the eye seeing the minute details of objects
569
whenever a figure is placed at a considerable distance you lose
first the distinctness of the smallest parts while the larger parts
are left to the last losing all distinctness of detail and outline
and what remains is an oval or spherical figure with confused edges

the density of a body of smoke looks white below the horizon while
above the horizon it is dark even if the smoke is in itself of a
uniform colour this uniformity will vary according to the variety

of the way to learn to compose figures in groups in historical
pictures
when you have well learnt perspective and have by heart the parts
and forms of objects you must go about and constantly as you go
observe note and consider the circumstances and behaviour of men in
talking quarrelling or laughing or fighting together the action of
the men themselves and the actions of the bystanders who separate
them or who look on and take a note of them with slight strokes
thus in a little book which you should always carry with you and
it should be of tinted paper that it may not be rubbed out but
change the old when full for a new one since these things should
not be rubbed out but preserved with great care for the forms and
positions of objects are so infinite that the memory is incapable of
retaining them wherefore keep these sketches as your guides and
masters
footnote among leonardos numerous note books of pocket size not
one has coloured paper so no sketches answering to this description
can be pointed out the fact that most of the notes are written in
ink militates against the supposition that they were made in the
open air
572
of a method of keeping in mind the form of a face
if you want to acquire facility for bearing in mind the expression
of a face first make yourself familiar with a variety of forms of
several heads eyes noses mouths chins and cheeks and necks and
shoulders and to put a case noses are of 10 types straight
bulbous hollow prominent above or below the middle aquiline
regular flat round or pointed these hold good as to profile in
full face they are of 11 types these are equal thick in the middle
thin in the middle with the tip thick and the root narrow or
narrow at the tip and wide at the root with the nostrils wide or
narrow high or low and the openings wide or hidden by the point
and you will find an equal variety in the other details which
things you must draw from nature and fix them in your mind or else
when you have to draw a face by heart carry with you a little book
in which you have noted such features and when you have cast a
glance at the face of the person you wish to draw you can look in
private which nose or mouth is most like or there make a little
mark to recognise it again at home of grotesque faces i need say
nothing because they are kept in mind without difficulty
the position of the head
573
how you should set to work to draw a head of which all the parts
shall agree with the position given to it
to draw a head in which the features shall agree with the turn and
bend of the head pursue this method you know that the eyes
eyebrows nostrils corners of the mouth and sides of the chin the
jaws cheeks ears and all the parts of a face are squarely and
straightly set upon the face
footnote compare the drawings and the text belonging to them on
pl ix no 315 pl x no 316 pl xl no 318 and pl xii
no 319
therefore when you have sketched the face draw lines passing from
one corner of the eye to the other and so for the placing of each
feature and after having drawn the ends of the lines beyond the two
sides of the face look if the spaces inside the same parallel lines
on the right and on the left are equal 12 but be sure to remember
to make these lines tend to the point of sight

of the light on the face 574576
574
how to know which side of an object is to be more or less luminous
than the other
let f be the light the head will be the object illuminated by it
and that side of the head on which the rays fall most directly will
be the most highly lighted and those parts on which the rays fall
most aslant will be less lighted the light falls as a blow might
since a blow which falls perpendicularly falls with the greatest
force and when it falls obliquely it is less forcible than the
former in proportion to the width of the angle exempli gratia if
you throw a ball at a wall of which the extremities are equally far
from you the blow will fall straight and if you throw the ball at
the wall when standing at one end of it the ball will hit it
obliquely and the blow will not tell
footnote see pl xxxi no 4 the sketch on the right hand side
575
the proof and reason why among the illuminated parts certain
portions are in higher light than others
since it is proved that every definite light is or seems to be
derived from one single point the side illuminated by it will have
its highest light on the portion where the line of radiance falls
perpendicularly as is shown above in the lines a g and also in
a h and in l a and that portion of the illuminated side will be
least luminous where the line of incidence strikes it between two
more dissimilar angles as is seen at b c d and by this means you
may also know which parts are deprived of light as is seen at m k
where the angles made by the lines of incidence are most equal there
will be the highest light and where they are most unequal it will
be darkest
i will make further mention of the reason of reflections

general suggestions for historical pictures 577581

precepts in painting
let you sketches of historical pictures be swift and the working out
of the limbs not be carried too far but limited to the position of
the limbs which you can afterwards finish as you please and at your
leisure
footnote see pl xxxviii no 2 the pen and ink drawing given
there as no 3 may also be compared with this passage it is in the
windsor collection where it is numbered 101
580
the sorest misfortune is when your views are in advance of your
work
581
of composing historical pictures of not considering the limbs in
the figures in historical pictures as many do who in the wish to
represent the whole of a figure spoil their compositions and when
you place one figure behind another take care to draw the whole of
it so that the limbs which come in front of the nearer figures may
stand out in their natural size and place

582
how the ages of man should be depicted that is infancy childhood
youth manhood old age decrepitude
footnote no answer is here given to this question in the original
ms
583
old men ought to be represented with slow and heavy movements their
legs bent at the knees when they stand still and their feet placed
parallel and apart bending low with the head leaning forward and
their arms but little extended
women must be represented in modest attitudes their legs close
together their arms closely folded their heads inclined and
somewhat on one side
old women should be represented with eager swift and furious
gestures like infernal furies but the action should be more
violent in their arms and head than in their legs
little children with lively and contorted movements when sitting
and when standing still in shy and timid attitudes

before 1500 and was very probably done at florence perhaps as a
preparatory study for some picture the type of hand with its
slender thin forms is more like the style of the vierge aux

instance
of representing the emotions
584
that a figure is not admirable unless it expresses by its action the
passion of its sentiment
that figure is most admirable which by its actions best expresses
the passion that animates it
how an angry man is to be figured
you must make an angry person holding someone by the hair wrenching
his head against the ground and with one knee on his ribs his
right arm and fist raised on high his hair must be thrown up his
brow downcast and knit his teeth clenched and the two corners of
his mouth grimly set his neck swelled and bent forward as he leans
over his foe and full of furrows
how to represent a man in despair
you must show a man in despair with a knife having already torn
open his garments and with one hand tearing open the wound and
make him standing on his feet and his legs somewhat bent and his
whole person leaning towards the earth his hair flying in disorder
of representing imaginary animals
585
how you should make an imaginary animal look natural
you know that you cannot invent animals without limbs each of
which in itself must resemble those of some other animal hence if
you wish to make an animal imagined by you appear naturallet us
say a dragon take for its head that of a mastiff or hound with the
eyes of a cat the ears of a porcupine the nose of a greyhound the
brow of a lion the temples of an old cock the neck of a water
tortoise
footnote the sketch here inserted of two men on horseback fighting
a dragon is the facsimile of a pen and ink drawing belonging to
baron edmond de rothschild of paris
the selection of forms
586
of the delusions which arise in judging of the limbs
a painter who has clumsy hands will paint similar hands in his
works and the same will occur with any limb unless long study has
taught him to avoid it therefore o painter look carefully what
part is most illfavoured in your own person and take particular
pains to correct it in your studies for if you are coarse your
figures will seem the same and devoid of charm and it is the same
with any part that may be good or poor in yourself it will be shown
in some degree in your figures
587
of the selection of beautiful faces
it seems to me to be no small charm in a painter when he gives his
figures a pleasing air and this grace if he have it not by nature
he may acquire by incidental study in this way look about you and
take the best parts of many beautiful faces of which the beauty is
confirmed rather by public fame than by your own judgment for you
might be mistaken and choose faces which have some resemblance to
your own for it would seem that such resemblances often please us
and if you should be ugly you would select faces that were not
beautiful and you would then make ugly faces as many painters do
for often a masters work resembles himself so select beauties as i
tell you and fix them in your mind
588
of the limbs which ought to be carefully selected and of all the
other parts with regard to painting
589
when selecting figures you should choose slender ones rather than
lean and wooden ones
590
of the muscles of animals
the hollow spaces interposed between the muscles must not be of such
a character as that the skin should seem to cover two sticks laid
side by side like c nor should they seem like two sticks somewhat
remote from such contact so that the skin hangs in an empty loose
curve as at f but it should be like i laid over the spongy fat
that lies in the angles as the angle n m o which angle is formed
by the contact of the ends of the muscles and as the skin cannot
fold down into such an angle nature has filled up such angles with
a small quantity of spongy and as i may say vesicular fat with
minute bladders in it full of air which is condensed or rarefied
in them according to the increase or the diminution of the substance
of the muscles in which latter case the concavity i always has a
larger curve than the muscle
591
of undulating movements and equipoise in figures and other animals
when representing a human figure or some graceful animal be careful
to avoid a wooden stiffness that is to say make them move with
equipoise and balance so as not to look like a piece of wood but
those you want to represent as strong you must not make so
excepting in the turn of the head
how to pose figures
592
of grace in the limbs
the limbs should be adapted to the body with grace and with
reference to the effect that you wish the figure to produce and if
you wish to produce a figure that shall of itself look light and
graceful you must make the limbs elegant and extended and without
too much display of the muscles and those few that are needed for
your purpose you must indicate softly that is not very prominent
and without strong shadows the limbs and particularly the arms
easy that is none of the limbs should be in a straight line with
the adjoining parts and if the hips which are the pole of a man
are by reason of his position placed so that the right is higher
than the left make the point of the higher shoulder in a
perpendicular line above the highest prominence of the hip and let
this right shoulder be lower than the left let the pit of the
throat always be over the centre of the joint of the foot on which
the man is leaning the leg which is free should have the knee lower
than the other and near the other leg the positions of the head
and arms are endless and i shall therefore not enlarge on any rules
for them still let them be easy and pleasing with various turns
and twists and the joints gracefully bent that they may not look
like pieces of wood
of appropriate gestures 593600
593
a picture or representation of human figures ought to be done in
such a way as that the spectator may easily recognise by means of
their attitudes the purpose in their minds thus if you have to
represent a man of noble character in the act of speaking let his
gestures be such as naturally accompany good words and in the same
way if you wish to depict a man of a brutal nature give him fierce
movements as with his arms flung out towards the listener and his
head and breast thrust forward beyond his feet as if following the
speakers hands thus it is with a deaf and dumb person who when he
sees two men in conversationalthough he is deprived of
hearingcan nevertheless understand from the attitudes and
gestures of the speakers the nature of their discussion i once saw
in florence a man who had become deaf who when you spoke very loud
did not understand you but if you spoke gently and without making
any sound understood merely from the movement of the lips now
perhaps you will say that the lips of a man who speaks loudly do not
move like those of one speaking softly and that if they were to
move them alike they would be alike understood as to this argument
i leave the decision to experiment make a man speak to you gently
and note the motion of his lips

of representing a man speaking to a multitude
when you wish to represent a man speaking to a number of people
consider the matter of which he has to treat and adapt his action to
the subject thus if he speaks persuasively let his action be
appropriate to it if the matter in hand be to set forth an
argument let the speaker with the fingers of the right hand hold
one finger of the left hand having the two smaller ones closed and
his face alert and turned towards the people with mouth a little
open to look as though he spoke and if he is sitting let him
appear as though about to rise with his head forward if you
represent him standing make him leaning slightly forward with body
and head towards the people these you must represent as silent and
attentive all looking at the orators face with gestures of
admiration and make some old men in astonishment at the things they
hear with the corners of their mouths pulled down and drawn in
their cheeks full of furrows and their eyebrows raised and
wrinkling the forehead where they meet again some sitting with
their fingers clasped holding their weary knees again some bent
old man with one knee crossed over the other on which let him hold
his hand with his other elbow resting in it and the hand supporting
his bearded chin

595
of the disposition of limbs
as regards the disposition of limbs in movement you will have to
consider that when you wish to represent a man who by some chance
has to turn backwards or to one side you must not make him move his
feet and all his limbs towards the side to which he turns his head
rather must you make the action proceed by degrees and through the
different joints that is those of the foot the knee and the hip
and the neck and if you set him on the right leg you must make the
left knee bend inwards and let his foot be slightly raised on the
outside and the left shoulder be somewhat lower than the right
while the nape of the neck is in a line directly over the outer
ancle of the left foot and the left shoulder will be in a
perpendicular line above the toes of the right foot and always set
your figures so that the side to which the head turns is not the
side to which the breast faces since nature for our convenience has
made us with a neck which bends with ease in many directions the
eye wishing to turn to various points the different joints and if
at any time you make a man sitting with his arms at work on
something which is sideways to him make the upper part of his body
turn upon the hips
footnote compare pl vii no 5 the original drawing at windsor
castle is numbered 104
596
when you draw the nude always sketch the whole figure and then
finish those limbs which seem to you the best but make them act
with the other limbs otherwise you will get a habit of never
putting the limbs well together on the body
never make the head turn the same way as the torso nor the arm and
leg move together on the same side and if the face is turned to the
right shoulder make all the parts lower on the left side than on
the right and when you turn the body with the breast outwards if
the head turns to the left side make the parts on the right side
higher than those on the left

suggestions for compositions
of painting battle pieces 601603
601
of the way of representing a battle
first you must represent the smoke of artillery mingling in the air
with the dust and tossed up by the movement of horses and the
combatants and this mixture you must express thus the dust being
a thing of earth has weight and although from its fineness it is
easily tossed up and mingles with the air it nevertheless readily
falls again it is the finest part that rises highest hence that
part will be least seen and will look almost of the same colour as
the air the higher the smoke mixed with the dustladen air rises
towards a certain level the more it will look like a dark cloud
and it will be seen that at the top where the smoke is more
separate from the dust the smoke will assume a bluish tinge and the
dust will tend to its colour this mixture of air smoke and dust
will look much lighter on the side whence the light comes than on
the opposite side the more the combatants are in this turmoil the
less will they be seen and the less contrast will there be in their
lights and shadows their faces and figures and their appearance
and the musketeers as well as those near them you must make of a
glowing red and this glow will diminish in proportion as it is
remote from its cause
the figures which are between you and the light if they be at a
distance will appear dark on a light background and the lower part
of their legs near the ground will be least visible because there
the dust is coarsest and densest 19 and if you introduce horses
galloping outside the crowd make the little clouds of dust distant
from each other in proportion to the strides made by the horses and
the clouds which are furthest removed from the horses should be
least visible make them high and spreading and thin and the nearer
ones will be more conspicuous and smaller and denser 23 the air
must be full of arrows in every direction some shooting upwards
some falling some flying level the balls from the guns must have a
train of smoke following their flight the figures in the foreground
you must make with dust on the hair and eyebrows and on other flat
places likely to retain it the conquerors you will make rushing
onwards with their hair and other light things flying on the wind
with their brows bent down
footnote 1923 compare 608 5775
602
and with the opposite limbs thrust forward that is where a man puts
forward the right foot the left arm must be advanced and if you
make any one fallen you must show the place where he has slipped
and been dragged along the dust into blood stained mire and in the
halfliquid earth arround show the print of the tramping of men and
horses who have passed that way make also a horse dragging the dead
body of his master and leaving behind him in the dust and mud the
track where the body was dragged along you must make the conquered
and beaten pale their brows raised and knit and the skin above
their brows furrowed with pain the sides of the nose with wrinkles
going in an arch from the nostrils to the eyes and make the
nostrils drawn upwhich is the cause of the lines of which i
speak and the lips arched upwards and discovering the upper
teeth and the teeth apart as with crying out and lamentation and
make some one shielding his terrified eyes with one hand the palm
towards the enemy while the other rests on the ground to support
his half raised body others represent shouting with their mouths
open and running away you must scatter arms of all sorts among the
feet of the combatants as broken shields lances broken swords and
other such objects and you must make the dead partly or entirely
covered with dust which is changed into crimson mire where it has
mingled with the flowing blood whose colour shows it issuing in a
sinuous stream from the corpse others must be represented in the
agonies of death grinding their teeth rolling their eyes with
their fists clenched against their bodies and their legs contorted
some might be shown disarmed and beaten down by the enemy turning
upon the foe with teeth and nails to take an inhuman and bitter
revenge you might see some riderless horse rushing among the enemy
with his mane flying in the wind and doing no little mischief with
his heels some maimed warrior may be seen fallen to the earth
covering himself with his shield while the enemy bending over him
tries to deal him a deathstroke there again might be seen a number
of men fallen in a heap over a dead horse you would see some of the
victors leaving the fight and issuing from the crowd rubbing their
eyes and cheeks with both hands to clean them of the dirt made by
their watering eyes smarting from the dust and smoke the reserves
may be seen standing hopeful but cautious with watchful eyes
shading them with their hands and gazing through the dense and murky
confusion attentive to the commands of their captain the captain
himself his staff raised hurries towards these auxiliaries
pointing to the spot where they are most needed and there may be a
river into which horses are galloping churning up the water all
round them into turbulent waves of foam and water tossed into the
air and among the legs and bodies of the horses and there must not
be a level spot that is not trampled with gore
603
of lighting the lower parts of bodies close together as of men in
battle
as to men and horses represented in battle their different parts
will be dark in proportion as they are nearer to the ground on which
they stand and this is proved by the sides of wells which grow
darker in proportion to their depth the reason of which is that the
deepest part of the well sees and receives a smaller amount of the
luminous atmosphere than any other part
and the pavement if it be of the same colour as the legs of these
said men and horses will always be more lighted and at a more
direct angle than the said legs c
604
of the way to represent a night scene
that which is entirely bereft of light is all darkness given a
night under these conditions and that you want to represent a night
scenearrange that there shall be a great fire then the objects
which are nearest to this fire will be most tinged with its colour
for those objects which are nearest to a coloured light participate
most in its nature as therefore you give the fire a red colour you
must make all the objects illuminated by it ruddy while those which

606
how to represent a tempest
if you wish to represent a tempest consider and arrange well its
effects as seen when the wind blowing over the face of the sea and
earth removes and carries with it such things as are not fixed to
the general mass and to represent the storm accurately you must
first show the clouds scattered and torn and flying with the wind
accompanied by clouds of sand blown up from the sea shore and
boughs and leaves swept along by the strength and fury of the blast
and scattered with other light objects through the air trees and
plants must be bent to the ground almost as if they would follow
the course of the gale with their branches twisted out of their
natural growth and their leaves tossed and turned about footnote
11 see pl xl no 2 of the men who are there some must have
fallen to the ground and be entangled in their garments and hardly
to be recognized for the dust while those who remain standing may
be behind some tree with their arms round it that the wind may not
tear them away others with their hands over their eyes for the
dust bending to the ground with their clothes and hair streaming in
the wind footnote 15 see pl xxxiv the right hand lower sketch
let the sea be rough and tempestuous and full of foam whirled among
the lofty waves while the wind flings the lighter spray through the
stormy air till it resembles a dense and swathing mist of the
ships that are therein some should be shown with rent sails and the
tatters fluttering through the air with ropes broken and masts
split and fallen and the ship itself lying in the trough of the sea
and wrecked by the fury of the waves with the men shrieking and
clinging to the fragments of the vessel make the clouds driven by
the impetuosity of the wind and flung against the lofty mountain
tops and wreathed and torn like waves beating upon rocks the air
itself terrible from the deep darkness caused by the dust and fog
and heavy clouds
of representing the deluge 607609
607
to represent the deluge
the air was darkened by the heavy rain whose oblique descent driven
aslant by the rush of the winds flew in drifts through the air not
otherwise than as we see dust varied only by the straight lines of
the heavy drops of falling water but it was tinged with the colour
of the fire kindled by the thunderbolts by which the clouds were
rent and shattered and whose flashes revealed the broad waters of
the inundated valleys above which was seen the verdure of the
bending tree tops neptune will be seen in the midst of the water
with his trident and 15 let aeolus with his winds be shown
entangling the trees floating uprooted and whirling in the huge
waves the horizon and the whole hemisphere were obscure but lurid
from the flashes of the incessant lightning men and birds might be
seen crowded on the tall trees which remained uncovered by the
swelling waters originators of the mountains which surround the
great abysses footnote 23 compare vol ii no 979
608
of the deluge and how to represent it in a picture
let the dark and gloomy air be seen buffeted by the rush of contrary
winds and dense from the continued rain mingled with hail and
bearing hither and thither an infinite number of branches torn from
the trees and mixed with numberless leaves all round may be seen
venerable trees uprooted and stripped by the fury of the winds and
fragments of mountains already scoured bare by the torrents
falling into those torrents and choking their valleys till the
swollen rivers overflow and submerge the wide lowlands and their
inhabitants again you might have seen on many of the hilltops
terrified animals of different kinds collected together and subdued
to tameness in company with men and women who had fled there with
their children the waters which covered the fields with their
waves were in great part strewn with tables bedsteads boats and
various other contrivances made from necessity and the fear of
death on which were men and women with their children amid sounds
of lamentation and weeping terrified by the fury of the winds which
with their tempestuous violence rolled the waters under and over and
about the bodies of the drowned nor was there any object lighter
than the water which was not covered with a variety of animals
which having come to a truce stood together in a frightened
crowdamong them wolves foxes snakes and othersfleing from
death and all the waters dashing on their shores seemed to be
battling them with the blows of drowned bodies blows which killed
those in whom any life remained 19 you might have seen
assemblages of men who with weapons in their hands defended the
small spots that remained to them against lions wolves and beasts
of prey who sought safety there ah what dreadful noises were heard
in the air rent by the fury of the thunder and the lightnings it
flashed forth which darted from the clouds dealing ruin and
striking all that opposed its course ah how many you might have
seen closing their ears with their hands to shut out the tremendous
sounds made in the darkened air by the raging of the winds mingling
with the rain the thunders of heaven and the fury of the
thunderbolts others were not content with shutting their eyes but
laid their hands one over the other to cover them the closer that
they might not see the cruel slaughter of the human race by the
wrath of god ah how many laments and how many in their terror
flung themselves from the rocks huge branches of great oaks loaded
with men were seen borne through the air by the impetuous fury of
the winds how many were the boats upset some entire and some
broken in pieces on the top of people labouring to escape with
gestures and actions of grief foretelling a fearful death others
with desperate act took their own lives hopeless of being able to
endure such suffering and of these some flung themselves from
lofty rocks others strangled themselves with their own hands other
seized their own children and violently slew them at a blow some
wounded and killed themselves with their own weapons others
falling on their knees recommended themselves to god ah how many
mothers wept over their drowned sons holding them upon their knees
with arms raised spread out towards heaven and with words and
various threatening gestures upbraiding the wrath of the gods
others with clasped hands and fingers clenched gnawed them and
devoured them till they bled crouching with their breast down on
their knees in their intense and unbearable anguish herds of
animals were to be seen such as horses oxen goats and swine
already environed by the waters and left isolated on the high peaks
of the mountains huddled together those in the middle climbing to
the top and treading on the others and fighting fiercely
themselves and many would die for lack of food already had the
birds begun to settle on men and on other animals finding no land
uncovered which was not occupied by living beings and already had
famine the minister of death taken the lives of the greater number
of the animals when the dead bodies now fermented where leaving
the depth of the waters and were rising to the top among the
buffeting waves where they were beating one against the other and
like as balls full of air rebounded from the point of concussion
these found a resting place on the bodies of the dead and above
these judgements the air was seen covered with dark clouds riven
by the forked flashes of the raging bolts of heaven lighting up on
all sides the depth of the gloom
the motion of the air is seen by the motion of the dust thrown up by
the horses running and this motion is as swift in again filling up
the vacuum left in the air which enclosed the horse as he is rapid
in passing away from the air
perhaps it will seem to you that you may reproach me with having
represented the currents made through the air by the motion of the
wind notwithstanding that the wind itself is not visible in the air
to this i must answer that it is not the motion of the wind but only
the motion of the things carried along by it which is seen in the
air

description of the deluge
let there be first represented the summit of a rugged mountain with
valleys surrounding its base and on its sides let the surface of
the soil be seen to slide together with the small roots of the
bushes denuding great portions of the surrounding rocks and
descending ruinous from these precipices in its boisterous course
let it dash along and lay bare the twisted and gnarled roots of
large trees overthrowing their roots upwards and let the mountains
as they are scoured bare discover the profound fissures made in
them by ancient earthquakes the base of the mountains may be in
great part clothed and covered with ruins of shrubs hurled down
from the sides of their lofty peaks which will be mixed with mud
roots boughs of trees with all sorts of leaves thrust in with the
mud and earth and stones and into the depth of some valley may have
fallen the fragments of a mountain forming a shore to the swollen
waters of its river which having already burst its banks will
rush on in monstrous waves and the greatest will strike upon and
destroy the walls of the cities and farmhouses in the valley 14
then the ruins of the high buildings in these cities will throw up a
great dust rising up in shape like smoke or wreathed clouds against
the falling rain but the swollen waters will sweep round the pool
which contains them striking in eddying whirlpools against the
different obstacles and leaping into the air in muddy foam then
falling back the beaten water will again be dashed into the air
and the whirling waves which fly from the place of concussion and
whose impetus moves them across other eddies going in a contrary
direction after their recoil will be tossed up into the air but
without dashing off from the surface where the water issues from
the pool the spent waves will be seen spreading out towards the
outlet and there falling or pouring through the air and gaining
weight and impetus they will strike on the water below piercing it
and rushing furiously to reach its depth from which being thrown
back it returns to the surface of the lake carrying up the air that
was submerged with it and this remains at the outlet in foam
mingled with logs of wood and other matters lighter than water
round these again are formed the beginnings of waves which increase
the more in circumference as they acquire more movement and this
movement rises less high in proportion as they acquire a broader
base and thus they are less conspicuous as they die away but if
these waves rebound from various objects they then return in direct
opposition to the others following them observing the same law of
increase in their curve as they have already acquired in the
movement they started with the rain as it falls from the clouds is
of the same colour as those clouds that is in its shaded side
unless indeed the suns rays should break through them in that case
the rain will appear less dark than the clouds and if the heavy
masses of ruin of large mountains or of other grand buildings fall
into the vast pools of water a great quantity will be flung into
the air and its movement will be in a contrary direction to that of
the object which struck the water that is to say the angle of
reflection will be equal to the angle of incidence of the objects
carried down by the current those which are heaviest or rather
largest in mass will keep farthest from the two opposite shores the
water in the eddies revolves more swiftly in proportion as it is
nearer to their centre the crests of the waves of the sea tumble to
their bases falling with friction on the bubbles of their sides and
this friction grinds the falling water into minute particles and
this being converted into a dense mist mingles with the gale in the
manner of curling smoke and wreathing clouds and at last it rises
into the air and is converted into clouds but the rain which falls
through the atmosphere being driven and tossed by the winds becomes
rarer or denser according to the rarity or density of the winds that
buffet it and thus there is generated in the atmosphere a moisture
formed of the transparent particles of the rain which is near to the
eye of the spectator the waves of the sea which break on the slope
of the mountains which bound it will foam from the velocity with
which they fall against these hills in rushing back they will meet
the next wave as it comes and and after a loud noise return in a
great flood to the sea whence they came let great numbers of
inhabitantsmen and animals of all kindsbe seen driven 54 by
the rising of the deluge to the peaks of the mountains in the midst
of the waters aforesaid

drops of water which fall from the clouds when it 16 rains
17 a mountain falling on a town will fling up dust in the form of
clouds but the colour of this dust will differ from that of the
clouds where the rain is thickest let the colour of the dust be
less conspicuous and where the dust is thickest let the rain be less
conspicuous and where the rain is mingled with the wind and with
the dust the clouds created by the rain must be more transparent
than those of dust alone and when flames of fire are mingled with
clouds of smoke and water very opaque and dark clouds will be formed

people were to be seen eagerly embarking victuals on various kinds
of hastily made barks but little of the waves were visible in those
places where the dark clouds and rain were reflected
but where the flashes caused by the bolts of heaven were reflected
there were seen as many bright spots caused by the image of the
flashes as there were waves to reflect them to the eye of the
spectator
the number of the images produced by the flash of lightning on the
waves of the water were multiplied in proportion to the distance of
the spectators eye
so also the number of the images was diminished in proportion as
they were nearer the eye which saw them footnote 22 23 come

mixture and filtered milk of an herb called calves foot and when
this paper is prepared and damped and folded and wrapped up it may
be mixed with the mixture and thus left to dry but if you break it
before it is moistened it becomes somewhat like the thin paste
called lasagne and you may then damp it and wrap it up and put it
in the mixture and leave it to dry or again this paper may be
covered with stiff transparent white and sardonio and then damped
so that it may not form angles and then covered up with strong
transparent size and as soon as it is firm cut it two fingers and
leave it to dry again you may make stiff cardboard of sardonio
and dry it and then place it between two sheets of papyrus and break
it inside with a wooden mallet with a handle and then open it with
care holding the lower sheet of paper flat and firm so that the
broken pieces be not separated then have a sheet of paper covered

chalk or burnt ochre for the dark shadows and for the lighter ones
red chalk and vermilion and for the lights pure vermilion and then
glaze with fine lake to make good oil for painting one part of

oil
make some oil of mustard seed and if you wish to make it with
greater ease mix the ground seeds with linseed oil and put it all
under the press
630
to remove the smell of oil
take the rank oil and put ten pints into a jar and make a mark on
the jar at the height of the oil then add to it a pint of vinegar
and make it boil till the oil has sunk to the level of the mark and
thus you will be certain that the oil is returned to its original
quantity and the vinegar will have gone off in vapour carrying with
it the evil smell and i believe you may do the same with nut oil or
any other oil that smells badly
631
since walnuts are enveloped in a thin rind which partakes of the
nature of  if you do not remove it when you make the oil from
them this skin tinges the oil and when you work with it this skin
separates from the oil and rises to the surface of the painting and
this is what makes it change
632
to restore oil colours that have become dry
if you want to restore oil colours that have become dry keep them
soaking in soft soap for a night and with your finger mix them up
with the soft soap then pour them into a cup and wash them with
water and in this way you can restore colours that have got dry
but take care that each colour has its own vessel to itself adding
the colour by degrees as you restore it and mind that they are
thoroughly softened and when you wish to use them for tempera wash
them five and six times with spring water and leave them to settle
if the soft soap should be thick with any of the colours pass it
through a filter footnote the same remark applies to these
sections as to no 618 and 619

634
 outside the bowl 2 fingers lower than the level of the oil and
pass it into the neck of a bottle and let it stand and thus all the
oil will separate from this milky liquid it will enter the bottle
and be as clear as crystal and grind your colours with this and
every coarse or viscid part will remain in the liquid you must know
that all the oils that have been created in seads or fruits are
quite clear by nature and the yellow colour you see in them only
comes of your not knowing how to draw it out fire or heat by its
nature has the power to make them acquire colour see for example
the exudation or gums of trees which partake of the nature of rosin
in a short time they harden because there is more heat in them than
in oil and after some time they acquire a certain yellow hue
tending to black but oil not having so much heat does not do so
although it hardens to some extent into sediment it becomes finer
the change in oil which occurs in painting proceeds from a certain
fungus of the nature of a husk which exists in the skin which covers
the nut and this being crushed along with the nuts and being of a
nature much resembling oil mixes with it it is of so subtle a
nature that it combines with all colours and then comes to the
surface and this it is which makes them change and if you want the
oil to be good and not to thicken put into it a little camphor
melted over a slow fire and mix it well with the oil and it will
never harden

varnish or powder
take cypress oil and distil it and have a large pitcher and put
in the extract with so much water as may make it appear like amber
and cover it tightly so that none may evaporate and when it is
dissolved you may add in your pitcher as much of the said solution
as shall make it liquid to your taste and you must know that amber
is the gum of the cypresstree
varnish or powder
and since varnish powder is the resin of juniper if you distil
juniper you can dissolve the said varnish powder in the essence

philosophy and history of the art of painting
the relation of art and nature 651 652
651
what is fair in men passes away but not so in art
652
he who despises painting loves neither philosophy nor nature
if you condemn painting which is the only imitator of all visible
works of nature you will certainly despise a subtle invention which
brings philosophy and subtle speculation to the consideration of the
nature of all formsseas and plains trees animals plants and
flowerswhich are surrounded by shade and light and this is true
knowledge and the legitimate issue of nature for painting is born
of natureor to speak more correctly we will say it is the
grandchild of nature for all visible things are produced by nature
and these her children have given birth to painting hence we may
justly call it the grandchild of nature and related to god
painting is superior to poetry 653 654
653
that painting surpasses all human works by the subtle considerations
belonging to it
the eye which is called the window of the soul is the principal
means by which the central sense can most completely and abundantly
appreciate the infinite works of nature and the ear is the second
which acquires dignity by hearing of the things the eye has seen if
you historians or poets or mathematicians had not seen things
with your eyes you could not report of them in writing and if you
0 poet tell a story with your pen the painter with his brush can
tell it more easily with simpler completeness and less tedious to
be understood and if you call painting dumb poetry the painter may
call poetry blind painting now which is the worse defect to be
blind or dumb though the poet is as free as the painter in the
invention of his fictions they are not so satisfactory to men as
paintings for though poetry is able to describe forms actions and
places in words the painter deals with the actual similitude of the
forms in order to represent them now tell me which is the nearer
to the actual man the name of man or the image of the man the name
of man differs in different countries but his form is never changed
but by death
654
and if the poet gratifies the sense by means of the ear the painter
does so by the eyethe worthier sense but i will say no more of
this but that if a good painter represents the fury of a battle
and if a poet describes one and they are both together put before
the public you will see where most of the spectators will stop to
which they will pay most attention on which they will bestow most
praise and which will satisfy them best undoubtedly painting being
by a long way the more intelligible and beautiful will please most
write up the name of god christ in some spot and setup his image
opposite and you will see which will be most reverenced painting
comprehends in itself all the forms of nature while you have
nothing but words which are not universal as form is and if you
have the effects of the representation we have the representation
of the effects take a poet who describes the beauty of a lady to
her lover and a painter who represents her and you will see to which
nature guides the enamoured critic certainly the proof should be
allowed to rest on the verdict of experience you have ranked
painting among the mechanical arts but in truth if painters were
as apt at praising their own works in writing as you are it would
not lie under the stigma of so base a name if you call it
mechanical because it is in the first place manual and that it is
the hand which produces what is to be found in the imagination you
too writers who set down manually with the pen what is devised in
your mind and if you say it is mechanical because it is done for
money who falls into this errorif error it can be calledmore
than you if you lecture in the schools do you not go to whoever
pays you most do you do any work without pay still i do not say
this as blaming such views for every form of labour looks for its
reward and if a poet should say i will invent a fiction with a
great purpose the painter can do the same as apelles painted
calumny if you were to say that poetry is more eternal i say the
works of a coppersmith are more eternal still for time preserves
them longer than your works or ours nevertheless they have not much
imagination 29 and a picture if painted on copper with enamel
colours may be yet more permanent we by our arts may be called the
grandsons of god if poetry deals with moral philosophy painting
deals with natural philosophy poetry describes the action of the
mind painting considers what the mind may effect by the motions of
the body if poetry can terrify people by hideous fictions
painting can do as much by depicting the same things in action
supposing that a poet applies himself to represent beauty ferocity
or a base a foul or a monstrous thing as against a painter he may
in his ways bring forth a variety of forms but will the painter not
satisfy more are there not pictures to be seen so like the actual
things that they deceive men and animals
painting is superior to sculpture 655 656
655
that sculpture is less intellectual than painting and lacks many
characteristics of nature
i myself having exercised myself no less in sculpture than in
painting and doing both one and the other in the same degree it
seems to me that i can without invidiousness pronounce an opinion
as to which of the two is of the greatest merit and difficulty and
perfection in the first place sculpture requires a certain light
that is from above a picture carries everywhere with it its own
light and shade thus sculpture owes its importance to light and
shade and the sculptor is aided in this by the nature of the
relief which is inherent in it while the painter whose art
expresses the accidental aspects of nature places his effects in
the spots where nature must necessarily produce them the sculptor
cannot diversify his work by the various natural colours of objects
painting is not defective in any particular the sculptor when he
uses perspective cannot make it in any way appear true that of the
painter can appear like a hundred miles beyond the picture itself
their works have no aerial perspective whatever they cannot
represent transparent bodies they cannot represent luminous bodies
nor reflected lights nor lustrous bodiesas mirrors and the like
polished surfaces nor mists nor dark skies nor an infinite number
of things which need not be told for fear of tedium as regards the
power of resisting time though they have this resistance footnote
19 from what is here said as to painting on copper it is very
evident that leonardo was not acquainted with the method of painting
in oil on thin copper plates introduced by the flemish painters of
the xviith century j lermolieff has already pointed out that in
the various collections containing pictures by the great masters of
the italian renaissance those painted on copper for instance the
famous reading magdalen in the dresden gallery are the works of a
much later date see zeitschrift fur bildende kunst vol x pg
333 and werke italienischer master in den galerien von munchen
dresden und berlin leipzig 1880 pg 158 and 159compare no
654 29 a picture painted on thick copper covered with white
enamel on which it is painted with enamel colours and then put into
the fire again and baked far exceeds sculpture in permanence it
may be said that if a mistake is made it is not easy to remedy it
it is but a poor argument to try to prove that a work be the nobler
because oversights are irremediable i should rather say that it
will be more difficult to improve the mind of the master who makes
such mistakes than to repair the work he has spoilt
656
we know very well that a really experienced and good painter will
not make such mistakes on the contrary with sound rules he will
remove so little at a time that he will bring his work to a good
issue again the sculptor if working in clay or wax can add or
reduce and when his model is finished it can easily be cast in
bronze and this is the last operation and is the most permanent
form of sculpture inasmuch as that which is merely of marble is
liable to ruin but not bronze hence a painting done on copper
which as i said of painting may be added to or altered resembles
sculpture in bronze which having first been made in wax could then
be altered or added to and if sculpture in bronze is durable this
work in copper and enamel is absolutely imperishable bronze is but
dark and rough after all but this latter is covered with various
and lovely colours in infinite variety as has been said above or
if you will have me only speak of painting on panel i am content to
pronounce between it and sculpture saying that painting is the more
beautiful and the more imaginative and the more copious while
sculpture is the more durable but it has nothing else sculpture
shows with little labour what in painting appears a miraculous thing
to do to make what is impalpable appear palpable flat objects
appear in relief distant objects seem close in fact painting is
adorned with infinite possibilities which sculpture cannot command
aphorisms 657659
657
of painting
men and words are ready made and you o painter if you do not know
how to make your figures move are like an orator who knows not how
to use his words
658
as soon as the poet ceases to represent in words what exists in
nature he in fact ceases to resemble the painter for if the poet
leaving such representation proceeds to describe the flowery and
flattering speech of the figure which he wishes to make the
speaker he then is an orator and no longer a poet nor a painter
and if he speaks of the heavens he becomes an astrologer and
philosopher and a theologian if he discourses of nature or god
but if he restricts himself to the description of objects he would
enter the lists against the painter if with words he could satisfy
the eye as the painter does
659
though you may be able to tell or write the exact description of
forms the painter can so depict them that they will appear alive
with the shadow and light which show the expression of a face which
you cannot accomplish with the pen though it can be achieved by the
brush
on the history of painting 660 661
660
that painting declines and deteriorates from age to age when
painters have no other standard than painting already done
hence the painter will produce pictures of small merit if he takes
for his standard the pictures of others but if he will study from
natural objects he will bear good fruit as was seen in the painters
after the romans who always imitated each other and so their art
constantly declined from age to age after these came giotto the
florentine whonot content with imitating the works of cimabue his
masterbeing born in the mountains and in a solitude inhabited only
by goats and such beasts and being guided by nature to his art
began by drawing on the rocks the movements of the goats of which he
was keeper and thus he began to draw all the animals which were to
be found in the country and in such wise that after much study he
excelled not only all the masters of his time but all those of many
bygone ages afterwards this art declined again because everyone
imitated the pictures that were already done thus it went on from
century to century until tomaso of florence nicknamed masaccio
showed by his perfect works how those who take for their standard
any one but naturethe mistress of all mastersweary themselves in
vain and i would say about these mathematical studies that those
who only study the authorities and not the works of nature are
descendants but not sons of nature the mistress of all good authors
oh how great is the folly of those who blame those who learn from
nature footnote 22 lasciando stare li autori in this
observation we may detect an indirect evidence that leonardo
regarded his knowledge of natural history as derived from his own
investigations as well as his theories of perspective and optics
compare what he says in praise of experience vol ii xix
setting aside those authorities who themselves were the disciples of
nature

studies and sketches for pictures and decorations
an artists manuscript notes can hardly be expected to contain any
thing more than incidental references to those masterpieces of his
work of which the fame sounded in the writings of his
contemporaries has left a glorious echo to posterity we need not
therefore be surprised to find that the texts here reproduced do not
afford us such comprehensive information as we could wish on the
other hand the sketches and studies prepared by leonardo for the
two grandest compositions he ever executed the fresco of the last
supper in the refectory of santa maria delle grazie at milan and
the cartoon of the battle of anghiari for the palazzo della
signoria at florencehave been preserved and though far from
complete are so much more numerous than the manuscript notes that
we are justified in asserting that in value and interest they amply
compensate for the meagerness of the written suggestions
the notes for the composition of the last supper which are given
under nos 665 and 666 occur in a ms at south kensington ii2
written in the years 14941495 this ms sketch was noted down not
more than three or four years before the painting was executed
which justifies the inference that at the time when it was written
the painter had not made up his mind definitely even as to the
general scheme of the work and from this we may also conclude that
the drawings of apostles heads at windsor in red chalk must be
ascribed to a later date they are studies for the head of st
matthew the fourth figure on christs left handsee pl xl vii
the sketch in black chalk for the head of st philip the third
figure on the left handsee pl xl viii for st peters right
armsee pl xlix and for the expressive head of judas which has
unfortunately somewhat suffered by subsequent restoration of
outlinessee pl l according to a tradition as unfounded as it
is improbable leonardo made use of the head of padre bandelli the
prior of the convent as the prototype of his judas this however
has already been contradicted by amoretti memorie storiche cap
xiv the study of the head of a criminal on pl li has it seems to
me a better claim to be regarded as one of the preparatory sketches
for the head of judas the windsor collection contains two old
copies of the head of st simon the figure to the extreme left of
christ both of about equal merit they are marked as nos 21 and
36the second was reproduced on pl viii of the grosvenor
gallery publication in 1878 there is also at windsor a drawing in
black chalk of folded hands marked with the old no 212 no lxi
of the grosvenor gallery publication which i believe to be a copy
of the hands of st john by some unknown pupil a reproduction of
the excellent drawings of heads of apostles in the possession of h
r h the grand duchess of weimar would have been out of my province
in this work and with regard to them i must confine myself to
pointing out that the difference in style does not allow of our
placing the weimar drawings in the same category as those here
reproduced the mode of grouping in the weimar drawings is of itself
sufficient to indicate that they were not executed before the
picture was painted but on the contrary afterwards and it is on
the face of it incredible that so great a master should thus have
copied from his own work
the drawing of christs head in the brera palace at milan was
perhaps originally the work of leonardos hand it has unfortunately
been entirely retouched and redrawn so that no decisive opinion
can be formed as to its genuineness
the red chalk drawing reproduced on pl xlvi is in the accademia at
venice it was probably made before the text nos 664 and 665
was written
the two pen and ink sketches on pl xlv seem to belong to an even
earlier date the more finished drawing of the two on the right
hand represents christ with only st john and judas and a third
disciple whose action is precisely that described in no 666
pl 4 it is hardly necessary to observe that the other sketches
on this page and the lines of text below the circle containing the
solution of a geometrical problem have no reference to the picture
of the last supper with this figure of christ may be compared a
similar pen and ink drawing reproduced on page 297 below on the
left hand the original is in the louvre on this page again the
rest of the sketches have no direct bearing on the composition of
the last supper not even as it seems to me the group of four men
at the bottom to the right handwho are listening to a fifth in
their midst addressing them moreover the writing on this page an
explanation of a disk shaped instrument is certainly not in the
same style as we find constantly used by leonardo after the year
1489
it may be incidentally remarked that no sketches are known for the
portrait of mona lisa nor do the ms notes ever allude to it
though according to vasari the master had it in hand for fully four
years
leonardos cartoon for the picture of the battle of anghiari has
shared the fate of the rival work michaelangelos bathers summoned
to battle both have been lost in some wholly inexplicable manner
i cannot here enter into the remarkable history of this work i can
only give an account of what has been preserved to us of leonardos
scheme and preparations for executing it the extent of the material
in studies and drawings was till now quite unknown their
publication here may give some adequate idea of the grandeur of this
famous work the text given as no 669 contains a description of
the particulars of the battle but for the reasons given in the note
to this text i must abandon the idea of taking this passage as the
basis of my attempt to reconstruct the picture as the artist
conceived and executed it
i may here remind the reader that leonardo prepared the cartoon in
the sala del papa of santa maria novella at florence and worked
there from the end of october 1503 till february 1504 and then was
busied with the painting in the sala del consiglio in the palazzo
della signoria till the work was interrupted at the end of may
1506 see milanesis note to vasari pp 4345 vol iv ed 1880
vasari as is well known describes only one scene or episode of the
cartoonthe battle for the standard in the foreground of the
composition as it would seem and this only was ever finished as a
mural decoration in the sala del consiglio this portion of the
composition is familiar to all from the disfigured copy engraved by
edelinck mariette had already very acutely observed that edelinck
must surely have worked from a flemish copy of the picture there is
in the louvre a drawing by rubens no 565 which also represents
four horsemen fighting round a standard and which agrees with
edelincks engraving but the engraving reverses the drawing an
earlier flemish drawing such as may have served as the model for
both rubens and edelinck is in the uffizi collection see
philpotss photograph no 732 it seems to be a work of the second
half of the xvith century a time when both the picture and the
cartoon had already been destroyed it is apparently the production
of a not very skilled hand raphael trichet du fresne 1651
mentions that a small picture by leonardo himself of the battle of
the standard was then extant in the tuileries by this he probably
means the painting on panel which is now in the possession of madame
timbal in paris and which has lately been engraved by haussoullier
as a work by leonardo the picture which is very carefully painted
seems to me however to be the work of some unknown florentine
painter and probably executed within the first ten years of the
xvith century at the same time it would seem to be a copy not from
leonardos cartoon but from his picture in the palazzo della
signoria at any rate this little picture and the small flemish
drawing in florence are the oldest finished copies of this episode
in the great composition of the battle of anghiari
in his life of raphael vasari tells us that raphael copied certain
works of leonardos during his stay in florence raphaels first
visit to florence lasted from the middle of october 1504 till july
1505 and he revisited it in the summer of 1506 the hasty sketch
now in the possession of the university of oxford and reproduced on
page 337 also represents the battle of the standard and seems to
have been made during his first stay and therefore not from the
fresco but from the cartoon for on the same sheet we also find
besides an old mans head drawn in leonardos style some studies
for the figure of st john the martyr which raphael used in 1505 in
his great fresco in the church of san severo at perugia
of leonardos studies for the battle of anghiari i must in the first
place point to five on three of whichpl lii 2 pl liii pl
lviwe find studies for the episode of the standard the standard
bearer who in the above named copies is seen stooping holding on
to the staff across his shoulder is immediately recognisable as the
lefthand figure in raphaels sketch and we find it in a similar
attitude in leonardos pen and ink drawing in the british
museumpl lii 2the lower figure to the right it is not
difficult to identify the same figure in two more complicated groups
in the pen and ink drawings now in the accademia at venicepl
liii and pl livwhere we also find some studies of foot soldiers
fighting on the sheet in the british museumpl lii 2we find
among others one group of three horses galloping forwards one
horseman is thrown and protects himself with his buckler against the
lance thrusts of two others on horseback who try to pierce him as
they ride past the same action is repeated with some variation in
two sketches in pen and ink on a third sheet in the accademia at
venice pl lv a coincidence which suggests the probability of such
an incident having actually been represented on the cartoon we are
not it is true in a position to declare with any certainty which
of these three dissimilar sketches may have been the nearest to the
group finally adopted in executing the cartoon
with regard however to one of the groups of horsemen it is
possible to determine with perfect certainty not only which
arrangement was preferred but the position it occupied in the
composition the group of horsemen on pl lvii is a drawing in black
chalk at windsor which is there attributed to leonardo but which
appears to me to be the work of cesare da sesto and the
commendatore giov morelli supports me in this view it can hardly
be doubted that da sesto as a pupil of leonardos made this
drawing from his masters cartoon if we compare it with the copy
made by raphaelhere reproduced for just above the fighting
horseman in raphaels copy it is possible to detect a horse which is
seen from behind going at a slower pace with his tail flying out
to the right and the same horse may be seen in the very same
attitude carrying a dimly sketched rider in the foreground of
cesare da sestos drawing
if a very much rubbed drawing in black chalk at windsorpl
lviis as it appears to be the reversed impression of an original
drawing it is not difficult to supplement from it the portions
drawn by cesare da sesto nay it may prove possible to reconstruct
the whole of the lost cartoon from the mass of materials we now have
at hand which we may regard as the nucleus of the composition a
large pen and ink drawing by raphael in the dresden collection
representing three horsemen fighting and another by cesare da
sesto in the uffizi of light horsemen fighting are a further
contribution which will help us to reconstruct it
the sketch reproduced on pl lv gives a suggestive example of the
way in which footsoldiers may have been introduced into the cartoon
as fighting among the groups of horsemen and i may here take the
opportunity of mentioning that for reasons which it would be out of
place to enlarge upon here i believe the two genuine drawings by
raphaels hand in his venetian sketchbook as it is calledone of
a standard bearer marching towards the left and one of two
footsoldiers armed with spears and fighting with a horsemanto be
undoubtedly copies from the cartoon of the battle of anghiari
leonardos two drawings preserved in the museum at budapesth and
reproduced on pages 338 and 339 are preliminary studies for the
heads of fighting warriors the two heads drawn in black chalk pg
338 and the one seen in profile turned to the left drawn in red
chalk pg 339 correspond exactly with those of two horsemen in
the scene of the fight round the standard as we see them in madame
timbals picture and in the other finished copies an old copy of
the last named drawing by a pupil of leonardo is in ms c a 187b
561b see saggio tav xxii leonardo used to make such finished
studies of heads as those drawn on detached sheets before
beginning his pictures from his drawingscompare the preparatory
studies for the fresco of the last supper given on pl xlvii and
pl l other drawings of heads all characterised by the expression
of vehement excitement that is appropriate to men fighting are to
be seen at windsor no 44 and at the accademia at venice iv 13
at the back of one of the drawings at budapesth there is the bust
of a warrior carrying a spear on his left shoulder holding up the
left arm see csatakepek a xvilk szazadbol osszeallitotta pvlszky
karoly these drawings may have been made for other portions of the
cartoon of which no copies exist and thus we are unable to
identify these preparatory drawings finally i may add that a sketch
of fighting horse and foot soldiers formerly in the possession of
m thiers and published by charles blanc in his vies des peintres
can hardly be accepted as genuine it is not to be found as i am
informed among the late presidents property and no one appears to
know where it now is
an attempted reconstruction of the cartoon which is not only
unsuccessful but perfectly unfounded is to be seen in the
lithograph by bergeret published in charles blancs vies des
peintres and reprinted in the great artists l da vinci p 80
this misleading pasticcio may now be rejected without hesitation
there are yet a few original drawings by leonardo which might be
mentioned here as possibly belonging to the cartoon of the battle
such as the pen and ink sketches on pl xxi and on pl xxxviii no
3 but we should risk too wide a departure from the domain of
ascertained fact
with regard to the colours and other materials used by leonardo the
reader may be referred to the quotations from the accounts for the
picture in question given by milanesi in his edition of vasari vol
iv p 44 note where we find entries of a similar character to
those in leonardos note books for the year 1505 s k m 12 see
no 636
that leonardo was employed in designing decorations and other
preparations for high festivals particularly for the court of
milan we learn not only from the writings of his contemporaries but
from his own incidental allusions for instance in ms c l5b 1
l 9 in the arrangement of the texts referring to this i have
placed those first in which historical personages are namednos
670674 among the descriptions of allegorical subjects two texts
lately found at oxford have been included nos 676 and 677 they
are particularly interesting because they are accompanied by large
sketches which render the meaning of the texts perfectly clear it
is very intelligible that in other cases where there are no
illustrative sketches the notes must necessarily remain obscure or
admit of various interpretations the literature of the time affords
ample evidence of the use of such allegorical representations
particularly during the carnival and in leonardos notes we find the
carnival expressly mentionednos 685 and 704 vasari in his life
of pontormo particularly describes that artists various
undertakings for carnival festivities these very graphic
descriptions appear to me to throw great light in more ways than one
on the meaning of leonardos various notes as to allegorical
representations and also on mottoes and emblemsnos 681702 in
passing judgment on the allegorical sketches and emblems it must not
be overlooked that even as pictures they were always accompanied by
explanations in words several finished drawings of allegorical
compositions or figures have been preserved but as they have no
corresponding explanation in the mss they had no claim to be
reproduced here the female figure on pl xxvi may perhaps be
regarded as a study for such an allegorical painting of which the
purport would have been explained by an inscription
on madonna pictures
663
in the autumn of 1478 i began the two madonna pictures
footnote photographs of this page have been published by braun
no 439 and philpot no 718
1 incominciai we have no other information as to the two
pictures of the madonna here spoken of as leonardo here tells us
that he had begun two madonnas at the same time the word
incominciai may be understood to mean that he had begun at the
same time preparatory studies for two pictures to be painted later
if this is so the nonexistence of the pictures may be explained by
supposing that they were only planned and never executed i may here
mention a few studies for pictures of the madonna which probably
belong to this early time particularly a drawing in silverpoint on
bluish tinted paper at windsorsee pl xl no 3 a drawing of
which the details have almost disappeared in the original but have
been rendered quite distinct in the reproduction secondly a slight
pen and ink sketch in the codex vallardi in the louvre fol 64
no 2316 again a silver point drawing of a virgin and child drawn
over again with the pen in the his de la salle collection also in
the louvre no 101 see vicomte both de tauzia notice des
dessins de la collection his de la salle exposes au louvre paris
1881 pp 80 81 this drawing is it is true traditionally
ascribed to raphael but the author of the catalogue very justly
points out its great resemblance with the sketches for madonnas in
the british museum which are indisputably leonardos some of these
have been published by mr henry wallis in the art journal new ser
no 14 feb 1882 if the nonexistence of the two pictures here
alluded to justifies my hypothesis that only studies for such
pictures are meant by the text it may also be supposed that the
drawings were made for some comrade in verrocchios atelier see
vasari sansonis ed florence 1880 vol iv p 564 e perche a
lerenzo piaceva fuor di modo la maniera di lionardo la seppe cosi
bene imitare che niuno fu che nella pulitezza e nel finir lopere
con diligenza limitasse piu di lui leonardos notes give me no
opportunity of discussing the pictures executed by him in florence
before he moved to milan so the studies for the unfinished picture
of the adoration of the magiin the uffizi florencecannot be
described here nor would any discussion about the picture in the
louvre la vierge aux rochers be appropriate in the absence of
all allusion to it in the mss therefore when i presently add a few
remarks on this painting in explanation of the masters drawings for
it it will be not merely with a view to facilitate critical
researches about the picture now in the national gallery london
which by some critics has been pronounced to be a replica of the
louvre picture but also because i take this opportunity of
publishing several finished studies of the masters which even if
they were not made in florence but later in milan must have been
prior to the painting of the last supper the original picture in
paris is at present so disfigured by dust and varnish that the
current reproductions in photography actually give evidence more of
the injuries to which the picture has been exposed than of the
original work itself the woodcut given on p 344 is only intended
to give a general notion of the composition it must be understood
that the outline and expression of the heads which in the picture
is obscured but not destroyed is here altogether missed the
facsimiles which follow are from drawings which appear to me to be
studies for la vierge aux rochers
1 a drawing in silver point on brown toned paper of a womans head
looking to the left in the royal library at turin apparently a
study from nature for the angels head pl xlii
2 a study of drapery for the left leg of the same figure done with
the brush indian ink on greenish paper the lights heightened with
white
the original is at windsor no 223 the reproduction pl xliii is
defective in the shadow on the upper part of the thigh which is not
so deep as in the original it should also be observed that the
folds of the drapery near the hips are somewhat altered in the
finished work in the louvre while the london copy shows a greater
resemblance to this study in that particular
3 a study in red chalk for the bust of the infant christno 3 in
the windsor collection pl xliv the wellknown silverpoint
drawing on pale green paper in the louvre of a boys head no 363
in reiset notice des dessins ecoles ditalie seems to me to be
a slightly altered copy either from the original picture or from
this red chalk study
4 a silverpoint study on greenish paper for the head of john the
baptist reproduced on p 342 this was formerly in the codex
vallardi and is now exhibited among the drawings in the louvre the
lights are in the original heightened with white the outlines
particularly round the head and ear are visibly restored
there is a study of an outstretched handno 288 in the windsor
collectionwhich was published in the grosvenor gallery
publication 1878 simply under the title of no 72 study of a
hand pointing which on the other hand i regard as a copy by a
pupil the action occurs in the kneeling angel of the paris picture
and not in the london copy
these four genuine studies form i believe a valuable substitute in

910 now the criminal represented here is none other than
bernardino di bandino baroncelli the murderer of giuliano demedici
whose name as a coadjutor in the conspiracy of the pazzi has gained
a melancholy notoriety by the tragedy of the 26th april 1478
bernardo was descended from an ancient family and the son of the man
who under king ferrante was president of the high court of justice
in naples his ruined fortunes it would seem induced him to join
the pazzi he and francesco pazzi were entrusted with the task of
murdering giuliano demedici on the fixed day their victim not
appearing in the cathedral at the hour when they expected him the
two conspirators ran to the palace of the medici and induced him to
accompany them giuliano then took his place in the chancel of the
cathedral and as the officiating priest raised the hostthe sign
agreed uponbernardo stabbed the unsuspecting giuliano in the
breast with a short sword giuliano stepped backwards and fell dead
the attempt on lorenzos life however by the other conspirators at
the same moment failed of success bernardo no sooner saw that
lorenzo tried to make his escape towards the sacristy than he
rushed upon him and struck down francesco nori who endeavoured to
protect lorenzo how lorenzo then took refuge behind the brazen
doors of the sacristy and how as soon as giulianos death was made
known the further plans of the conspirators were defeated while a
terrible vengeance overtook all the perpetrators and accomplices
this is no place to tell bernardo bandini alone seemed to be
favoured by fortune he hid first in the tower of the cathedral and
then escaped undiscovered from florence poliziano who was with
lorenzo in the cathedral says in his conjurationis pactianae
commentarium bandinus fugitans in tiphernatem incidit a quo in
aciem receptus senas pervenit and gino capponi in summing up the
reports of the numerous contemporary narrators of the event says
bernardo bandini ricoverato in costantinopoli fu per ordine del
sultano preso e consegnato a un antonio di bernardino dei medici
che lorenzo aveva mandato apposta in turchia cosi era grande la
potenza di quest uomo e grande la voglia di farne mostra e che non
restasse in vita chi aveagli ucciso il fratello fu egli applicato

stette it may however be mentioned with reference to the mode of
writing the name of the assassin that though most of his
contemporaries wrote bernardo bandini in the breve chronicon
caroli petri de joanninis he is called bernardo di bandini
baroncelli and in the sententiae domini matthaei de toscana
bernardus joannis bandini de baroncellis as is written on
leonardos drawing of him when hanged now vasari in the life of
andrea del castagno vol ii 680 ed milanesi 1878 tells us
that in 1478 this painter was commissioned by order of the signoria
to represent the members of the pazzi conspiracy as traitors on the
facade of the palazzo del podestathe bargello this statement is
obviously founded on a mistake for andrea del castagno was already
dead in 1457 he had however been commissioned to paint rinaldo
degli albizzi when declared a rebel and exiled in 1434 and his
adherents as hanging head downwards and in consequence he had
acquired the nickname of andrea degl impiccati on the 21st july
1478 the council of eight came to the following resolution item
servatis etc deliberaverunt et santiaverunt sandro botticelli pro
ejus labore in pingendo proditores flor quadraginta largos see
g milanesi arch star vi 1862 p 5 note
as has been told giuliano de medici was murdered on the 26th april
1478 and we see by this that only three months later botticelli was
paid for his painting of the proditores we can however hardly
suppose that all the members of the conspiracy were depicted by him
in fresco on the facade of the palace since no fewer than eighty
had been condemned to death we have no means of knowing whether
besides botticelli any other painters perhaps leonardo was
commissioned when the criminals had been hanged in person out of
the windows of the palazzo del podesta to represent them there
afterwards in effigy in memory of their disgrace nor do we know
whether the assassin who had escaped may at first not have been
provisionally represented as hanged in effigy now when we try to
connect the historical facts with this drawing by leonardo
reproduced on pl lxii no i and the full description of the
conspirators dress and its colour on the same sheet there seems to
be no reasonable doubt that bernardo bandini is here represented as
he was actually hanged on december 29th 1479 after his capture at
constantinople the dress is certainly not that in which he
committed the murder a long furred coat might very well be worn at
constantinople or at florence in december but hardly in april the
doubt remains whether leonardo described bernardos dress so fully
because it struck him as remarkable or whether we may not rather
suppose that this sketch was actually made from nature with the
intention of using it as a study for a wall painting to be executed
it cannot be denied that the drawing has all the appearance of
having been made for this purpose be this as it may the sketch
under discussion proves at any rate that leonardo was in florence
in december 1479 and the note that accompanies it is valuable as
adding one more characteristic specimen to the very small number of
his mss that can be proved to have been written between 1470 and
1480

turned his head towards the speaker

brows to his companion 6 another with his hands spread open shows
the palms and shrugs his shoulders up his ears making a mouth of
astonishment 8

him turns towards him to lend an ear 10 while he holds a knife
in one hand and in the other the loaf half cut through by the
knife 13 another who has turned holding a knife in his hand
upsets with his hand a glass on the table 14
footnote 665 666 in the original ms there is no sketch to
accompany these passages and if we compare them with those drawings
made by leonardo in preparation for the composition of the
picturepl xlv xlvi compare also pl lii 1 and the drawings
on p 297 it is impossible to recognise in them a faithful
interpretation of the whole of this text but if we compare these
passages with the finished picture see p 334 we shall see that in
many places they coincide for instance compare no 665 1 68
with the fourth figure on the right hand of christ the various
actions described in lines 910 1314 are to be seen in the group
of peter john and judas in the finished picture however it is not

mouthful 3 another leans forward to see the speaker shading his
eyes with his hand 5 another draws back behind the one who leans
forward and sees the speaker between the wall and the man who is

having misread this word written cinato in the original and
having altered it to ciclo when i first published this text in
the academy for nov 8 1879 immediately after i had discovered
it and subsequently in the small biography of leonardo da vinci

footnote as this note is in the same small manuscript as the
passage here immediately preceding it i may be justified in
assuming that leonardo meant to use the features of the person here
named as a suitable model for the figure of christ the celebrated
drawing of the head of christ now hanging in the brera gallery at
milan has obviously been so much restored that it is now impossible
to say whether it was ever genuine we have only to compare it with
the undoubtedly genuine drawings of heads of the disciples in pi
xlvii xlviii and l to admit that not a single line of the milan
drawing in its present state can be by the same hand

begin with the address of niccolo piccinino to the soldiers and the
banished florentines among whom are messer rinaldo degli albizzi and
other florentines then let it be shown how he first mounted on
horseback in armour and the whole army came after him40 squadrons
of cavalry and 2000 foot soldiers went with him very early in the
morning the patriarch went up a hill to reconnoitre the country
that is the hills fields and the valley watered by a river and
from thence he beheld niccolo picinino coming from borgo san
sepolcro with his people and with a great dust and perceiving them
he returned to the camp of his own people and addressed them having
spoken he prayed to god with clasped hands when there appeared a
cloud in which saint peter appeared and spoke to the patriarch500
cavalry were sent forward by the patriarch to hinder or check the
rush of the enemy in the foremost troop francesco the son of
niccolo piccinino 24 was the first to attack the bridge which was
held by the patriarch and the florentines beyond the bridge to his
left he sent forward some infantry to engage ours who drove them
back among whom was their captain micheletto 29 whose lot it was
to be that day at the head of the army here at this bridge there
is a severe struggle our men conquer and the enemy is repulsed
here guido and astorre his brother the lord of faenza with a great
number of men reformed and renewed the fight and rushed upon the
florentines with such force that they recovered the bridge and
pushed forward as far as the tents but simonetto advanced with 600
horse and fell upon the enemy and drove them back once more from
the place and recaptured the bridge and behind him came more men
with 2000 horse soldiers and thus for a long time they fought with
varying fortune but then the patriarch in order to divert the
enemy sent forward niccolo da pisa 44 and napoleone orsino a
beardless lad followed by a great multitude of men and then was
done another great feat of arms at the same time niccolo piccinino
urged forward the remnant of his men who once more made ours give
way and if it had not been that the patriarch set himself at their
head and by his words and deeds controlled the captains our
soldiers would have taken to flight the patriarch had some
artillery placed on the hill and with these he dispersed the enemys
infantry and the disorder was so complete that niccolo began to
call back his son and all his men and they took to flight towards
borgo and then began a great slaughter of men none escaped but the
foremost of those who had fled or who hid themselves the battle
continued until sunset when the patriarch gave his mind to
recalling his men and burying the dead and afterwards a trophy was
erected
footnote 669 this passage does not seem to me to be in leonardos
hand though it has hitherto been generally accepted as genuine not
only is the writing unlike his but the spelling also is quite
different i would suggest that this passage is a description of the
events of the battle drawn up for the painter by order of the
signoria perhaps by some historian commissioned by them to serve
as a scheme or programme of the work the whole tenor of the style
seems to me to argue in favour of this theory and besides it would
be in no way surprising that such a document should have been
preserved among leonardos autographs

can be no doubt grimani antonio grimani was the famous doge who in

after the abortive conclusion of the expeditionludovico being the
ally of the turks who took possession of friuli grimani was driven
into exile he went to live at rome with his son cardinal domenico
grimani on being recalled to venice he filled the office of doge
from 1521 to 1523 antonio maria probably means antonio maria

pleasure and pain represent as twins since there never is one
without the other and as if they were united back to back since
they are contrary to each other
6 clay gold
footnote 7 oro fango gold clay these words stand below the
allegorical figure
if you take pleasure know that he has behind him one who will deal
you tribulation and repentance
9 this represents pleasure together with pain and show them as
twins because one is never apart from the other they are back to
back because they are opposed to each other and they exist as
contraries in the same body because they have the same basis
inasmuch as the origin of pleasure is labour and pain and the
various forms of evil pleasure are the origin of pain therefore it
is here represented with a reed in his right hand which is useless
and without strength and the wounds it inflicts are poisoned in
tuscany they are put to support beds to signify that it is here
that vain dreams come and here a great part of life is consumed it
is here that much precious time is wasted that is in the morning
when the mind is composed and rested and the body is made fit to
begin new labours there again many vain pleasures are enjoyed both
by the mind in imagining impossible things and by the body in
taking those pleasures that are often the cause of the failing of
life and for these reasons the reed is held as their support

passage
footnote 8 tribolatione in the drawing caltrops may be seen
lying in the old mans right hand others are falling and others
again are shewn on the ground similar caltrops are drawn in ms
tri p 98 and underneath them as well as on page 96 the words
triboli di ferro are written from the accompanying text it
appears that they were intended to be scattered on the ground at the
bottom of ditches to hinder the advance of the enemy count giulio
porro who published a short account of the trivulzio ms in the
archivio storico lombardo anno viii part iv dec 31 1881 has
this note on the passages treating of triboli e qui
aggiungero che anni sono quando venne fabbricata la nuova
cavallerizza presso il castello di milano ne furono trovati due che
io ho veduto ed erano precisamente quali si trovano descritti e
disegnati da leonardo in questo codice
there can therefore be no doubt that this means of defence was in
general use whether it were originally leonardos invention or not
the play on the word tribolatione as it occurs in the drawing
at oxford must then have been quite intelligible
footnote 922 these lines in the original are written on the
left side of the page and refer to the figure shown on pi lxi next
to it is placed the group of three figures given in pi lx no i
lines 21 and 22 which are written under it are the only
explanation given
evilthinking is either envy or ingratitude
677
envy must be represented with a contemptuous motion of the hand
towards heaven because if she could she would use her strength
against god make her with her face covered by a mask of fair
seeming show her as wounded in the eye by a palm branch and by an
olivebranch and wounded in the ear by laurel and myrtle to
signify that victory and truth are odious to her many thunderbolts
should proceed from her to signify her evil speaking let her be
lean and haggard because she is in perpetual torment make her heart
gnawed by a swelling serpent and make her with a quiver with
tongues serving as arrows because she often offends with it give
her a leopards skin because this creature kills the lion out of
envy and by deceit give her too a vase in her hand full of flowers
and scorpions and toads and other venomous creatures make her ride
upon death because envy never dying never tires of ruling make
her bridle and load her with divers kinds of arms because all her
weapons are deadly
toleration
intolerable
no sooner is virtue born than envy comes into the world to attack
it and sooner will there be a body without a shadow than virtue
without envy

be sliding down a stretched string leonardos flying machines and

a dress for the carnival
to make a beautiful dress cut it in thin cloth and give it an
odoriferous varnish made of oil of turpentine and of varnish in
grain with a pierced stencil which must be wetted that it may not
stick to the cloth and this stencil may be made in a pattern of
knots which afterwards may be filled up with black and the ground
with white milletfootnote 7 the grains of black and white millet
would stick to the varnish and look like embroidery
footnote ser giuliano da vinci the painters brother had been
commissioned with some others to order and to execute the garments
of the allegorical figures for the carnival at florence in 151516

the notes on sculpture
compared with the mass of manuscript treating of painting a very
small number of passages bearing on the practice and methods of
sculpture are to be found scattered through the note books these
are here given at the beginning of this section nos 706709
there is less cause for surprise at finding that the equestrian
statue of francesco sforza is only incidentally spoken of for
although leonardo must have worked at it for a long succession of
years it is not in the nature of the case that it could have given
rise to much writing we may therefore regard it as particularly
fortunate that no fewer than thirteen notes in the masters
handwriting can be brought together which seem to throw light on
the mysterious history of this famous work until now writers on
leonardo were acquainted only with the passages numbered 712 719
720 722 and 723
in arranging these notes on sculpture i have given the precedence to
those which treat of the casting of the monument not merely because
they are the fullest but more especially with a view to
reconstructing the monument an achievement which really almost lies
within our reach by combining and comparing the whole of the
materials now brought to light alike in notes and in sketches
a good deal of the first two passages nos 710 and 711 which refer
to this subject seems obscure and incomprehensible still they
supplement each other and one contributes in no small degree to the
comprehension of the other a very interesting and instructive
commentary on these passages may be found in the fourth chapter of
vasaris introduzione della scultura under the title come si fanno
i modelli per fare di bronzo le figure grandi e picciole e come le
forme per buttarle come si armino di ferri e come si gettino di
metallo c among the drawings of models of the moulds for casting
we find only one which seems to represent the horse in the act of
gallopingno 713 all the other designs show the horse as pacing
quietly and as these studies of the horse are accompanied by copious
notes as to the method of casting the question as to the position
of the horse in the model finally selected seems to be decided by
preponderating evidence il cavallo dello sforzac boito remarks
very appositely in the saggio on page 26 doveva sembrare fratello
al cavallo del colleoni e si direbbe che questo fosse figlio del
cavallo del gattamelata il quale pare figlio di uno dei quattro
cavalli che stavano forse sull arco di nerone in roma now at
venice the publication of the saggio also contains the
reproduction of a drawing in red chalk representing a horse walking
to the left and supported by a scaffolding given here on pl lxxvi
no 1 it must remain uncertain whether this represents the model as
it stood during the preparations for casting it or whetheras
seems to me highly improbablethis sketch shows the model as it was
exhibited in 1493 on the piazza del castello in milan under a
triumphal arch on the occasion of the marriage of the emperor
maximilian to bianca maria sforza the only important point here is
to prove that strong evidence seems to show that of the numerous
studies for the equestrian statue only those which represent the
horse pacing agree with the schemes of the final plans
the second group of preparatory sketches representing the horse as
galloping must therefore be considered separately a distinction
which in recapitulating the history of the origin of the monument
seems justified by the note given under no 720
galeazza maria sforza was assassinated in 1476 before his scheme for
erecting a monument to his father francesco sforza could be carried
into effect in the following year ludovico il moro the young
aspirant to the throne was exiled to pisa and only returned to
milan in 1479 when he was lord governatore of the state of milan
in 1480 after the minister cecco simonetta had been murdered it may
have been soon after this that ludovico il moro announced a
competition for an equestrian statue and it is tolerably certain
that antonio del pollajuolo took part in it from this passage in
vasaris life of this artist e si trovo dopo la morte sua il
disegno e modello che a lodovico sforza egli aveva fatto per la
statua a cavallo di francesco sforza duca di milano il quale
disegno e nel nostro libro in due modi in uno egli ha sotto
verona nellaltro egli tutto armato e sopra un basamento pieno di
battaglie fa saltare il cavallo addosso a un armato ma la cagione
perche non mettesse questi disegni in opera non ho gia potuto
sapere one of pollajuolos drawings as here described has lately
been discovered by senatore giovanni morelli in the munich
pinacothek here the profile of the horseman is a portrait of
francesco duke of milan and under the horse who is galloping to
the left we see a warrior thrown and lying on the ground precisely
the same idea as we find in some of leonardos designs for the
monument as on pl lxvi lxvii lxviii lxix and lxxii no 1 and
as it is impossible to explain this remarkable coincidence by
supposing that either artist borrowed it from the other we can only
conclude that in the terms of the competition the subject proposed
was the duke on a horse in full gallop with a fallen foe under its
hoofs
leonardo may have been in the competition there and then but the
means for executing the monument do not seem to have been at once
forthcoming it was not perhaps until some years later that leonardo
in a letter to the duke no 719 reminded him of the project for
the monument then after he had obeyed a summons to milan the plan
seems to have been so far modified perhaps in consequence of a
remonstrance on the part of the artist that a pacing horse was
substituted for one galloping and it may have been at the same time
that the colossal dimensions of the statue were first decided on
the designs given on pl lxx lxxi lxxii 2 and 3 lxxiii and lxxiv
and on pp 4 and 24 as well as three sketches on pl lxix may be
studied with reference to the project in its new form though it is
hardly possible to believe that in either of these we see the design
as it was actually carried out it is probable that in milan
leonardo worked less on drawings than in making small models of wax
and clay as preparatory to his larger model among the drawings
enumerated above one in black chalk pl lxxiiithe upper sketch
on the right hand side reminds us strongly of the antique statue of
marcus aurelius if as it would seem leonardo had not until then
visited rome he might easily have known this statue from drawings
by his former master and friend verrocchio for verrocchio had been
in rome for a long time between 1470 and 1480 in 1473 pope sixtus
iv had this antique equestrian statue restored and placed on a new
pedestal in front of the church of san giovanni in luterano
leonardo although he was painting independently as early as in 1472
is still spoken of as working in verrocchios studio in 1477 two
years later the venetian senate decided on erecting an equestrian
statue to colleoni and as verrocchio to whom the work was
entrusted did not at once move from florence to venicewhere he
died in 1488 before the casting was completedbut on the contrary
remained in florence for some years perhaps even till 1485
leonardo probably had the opportunity of seeing all his designs for
the equestrian statue at venice and the red chalk drawing on pl
lxxiv may be a reminiscence of it
the pen and ink drawing on pl lxxii no 3 reminds us of
donatellos statue of gattamelata at padua however it does not
appear that leonardo was ever at padua before 1499 but we may
conclude that he took a special interest in this early bronze statue
and the reports he could procure of it form an incidental remark
which is to be found in c a 145a 432a and which will be given in
vol ii under ricordi or memoranda among the studiesin the widest
sense of the wordmade in preparation statue we may include the
anatomy of the horse which lomazzo and vas mention the most
important parts of this work still exist in the queens li windsor
it was beyond a doubt compiled by leonardo when at milan only
interesting records to be found among these designs are reproduced
in nos 716a but it must be pointed out that out of 40 sheets of
studies of the movements of the belonging to that treatise a horse
in full gallop occurs but once
if we may trust the account given by paulus joviusabout l527
leonardos horse was represented as vehementer incitatus et
anhelatus jovius had probably seen the model exhibited at milan
but need we in fact infer from this description that the horse
was galloping compare vasaris description of the gattamelata
monument at padua egli donatello vi ando ben volentieri e fece
il cavallo di bronzo che e in sulla piazza di sant antonio nel
quale si dimostra lo sbuffamento ed il fremito del cavallo ed il
grande animo e la fierezza vivacissimamente espressa dallarte nella
figura che lo cavalca
these descriptions it seems to me would only serve to mark the
difference between the work of the middle ages and that of the
renaissance
we learn from a statement of sabba da castiglione that when milan
was taken by the french in 1499 the model sustained some injury
and this informant who however is not invariably trustworthy adds
that leonardo had devoted fully sixteen years to this work la forma
del cavallo intorno a cui leonardo avea sedici anni continui
consumati this oftenquoted passage has given ground for an
assumption which has no other evidence to support it that leonardo
had lived in milan ever since 1483 but i believe it is nearer the
truth to suppose that this authors statement alludes to the fact
that about sixteen years must have past since the competition in
which leonardo had taken part
i must in these remarks confine myself strictly to the task in hand
and give no more of the history of the sforza monument than is
needed to explain the texts and drawings i have been able to
reproduce in the first place with regard to the drawings i may
observe that they are all with the following two exceptions in the
queens library at windsor castle the red chalk drawing on pl
lxxvi no 1 is in the ms c a see no 7l2 and the fragmentary
pen and ink drawing on page 4 is in the ambrosian library the
drawings from windsor on pl lxvi have undergone a trifling
reduction from the size of the originals
there can no longer be the slightest doubt that the wellknown
engraving of several horsemen passavant le peintregraveur vol
v p 181 no 3 is only a copy after original drawings by
leonardo executed by some unknown engraver we have only to compare
the engraving with the facsimiles of drawings on pl lxv no 2 pl
lxvii lxviii and lxix which it is quite evident have served as
models for the engraver
on pl lxv no 1 in the larger sketch to the right hand only the
base is distinctly visible the figure of the horseman is effaced
leonardo evidently found it unsatisfactory and therefore rubbed it
out
the base of the monumentthe pedestal for the equestrian statueis
repeatedly sketched on a magnificent plan in the sketch just
mentioned it has the character of a shrine or aedicula to contain a
sarcophagus captives in chains are here represented on the
entablature with their backs turned to that portion of the monument
which more
strictly constitutes the pedestal of the horse the lower portion of
the aedicula is surrounded by columns in the pen and ink drawing
pl lxvithe lower drawing on the right hand sidethe sarcophagus
is shown between the columns and above the entablature is a plinth
on which the horse stands but this arrangement perhaps seemed to
leonardo to lack solidity and in the little sketch on the left
hand below the sarcophagus is shown as lying under an arched
canopy in this the trophies and the captive warriors are detached
from the angles in the first of these two sketches the place for
the trophies is merely indicated by a few strokes in the third
sketch on the left the base is altogether broader buttresses and
pinnacles having been added so as to form three niches the black
chalk drawing on pl lxviii shows a base in which the angles are
formed by niches with pilasters in the little sketch to the extreme
left on pl lxv no 1 the equestrian statue serves to crown a
circular temple somewhat resembling bramantes tempietto of san
pietro in montario at rome while the sketch above to the right
displays an arrangement faintly reminding us of the tomb of the
scaligers in verona the base is thus constructed of two platforms
or slabs the upper one considerably smaller than the lower one
which is supported on flying buttresses with pinnacles
on looking over the numerous studies in which the horse is not
galloping but merely walking forward we find only one drawing for
the pedestal and this to accord with the altered character of the
statue is quieter and simpler in style pl lxxiv it rises almost
vertically from the ground and is exactly as long as the pacing
horse the whole base is here arranged either as an independent
baldaquin or else as a projecting canopy over a recess in which the
figure of the deceased duke is seen lying on his sarcophagus in the
latter case it was probably intended as a tomb inside a church
here too it was intended to fill the angles with trophies or
captive warriors probably only no 724 in the text refers to the
work for the base of the monument
if we compare the last mentioned sketch with the description of a
plan for an equestrian monument to gian giacomo trivulzio no 725
it seems by no means impossible that this drawing is a preparatory
study for the very monument concerning which the manuscript gives us
detailed information we have no historical record regarding this
sketch nor do the archives in the trivulzio palace give us any
information the simple monument to the great general in san nazaro
maggiore in milan consists merely of a sarcophagus placed in recess
high on the wall of an octagonal chapel the figure of the warrior
is lying on the sarcophagus on which his name is inscribed a piece
of sculpture which is certainly not leonardos work gian giacomo
trivulzio died at chartres in 1518 only five months before
leonardo and it seems to me highly improbable that this should have
been the date of this sketch under these circumstances it would
have been done under the auspices of francis i but the italian
general was certainly not in favour with the french monarch at the
time gian giacomo trivulzio was a sworn foe to ludovico il moro
whom he strove for years to overthrow on the 6th september 1499 he
marched victorious into milan at the head of a french army in a
short time however he was forced to quit milan again when ludovico
il moro bore down upon the city with a force of swiss troops on the
15th of april following after defeating lodovico at novara
trivulzio once more entered milan as a conqueror but his hopes of
becoming governatore of the place were soon wrecked by intrigue
this victory and triumph historians tell us were signalised by
acts of vengeance against the dethroned sforza and it might have
been particularly flattering to him that the casting and
construction of the sforza monument were suspended for the time
it must have been at this momentas it seems to methat he
commissioned the artist to prepare designs for his own monument
which he probably intended should find a place in the cathedral or
in some other church he the husband of margherita di nicolino
colleoni would have thought that he had a claim to the same
distinction and public homage as his less illustrious connection had
received at the hands of the venetian republic it was at this very
time that trivulzio had a medal struck with a bust portrait of
himself and the following remarkable inscription on the reverse

ludovicussvperatvs et captvsestabeo in the library of
the palazzo trivulzio there is a ms of callimachus siculus written
at the end of the xvth or beginning of the xvith century at the
beginning of this ms there is an exquisite illuminated miniature of
an equestrian statue with the name of the general on the base it is
however very doubtful whether this has any connection with
leonardos design
nos 731740 which treat of casting bronze have probably a very
indirect bearing on the arrangements made for casting the equestrian
statue of francesco sforza some portions evidently relate to the
casting of cannon still in our researches about leonardos work on
the monument we may refer to them as giving us some clue to the
process of bronze casting at that period
some practical hints 706709
7o6
of a statue
if you wish to make a figure in marble first make one of clay and
when you have finished it let it dry and place it in a case which
should be large enough after the figure is taken out of it to
receive also the marble from which you intend to reveal the figure
in imitation of the one in clay after you have put the clay figure
into this said case have little rods which will exactly slip in to
the holes in it and thrust them so far in at each hole that each
white rod may touch the figure in different parts of it and colour
the portion of the rod that remains outside black and mark each rod
and each hole with a countersign so that each may fit into its
place then take the clay figure out of this case and put in your
piece of marble taking off so much of the marble that all your rods
may be hidden in the holes as far as their marks and to be the
better able to do this make the case so that it can be lifted up
but the bottom of it will always remain under the marble and in this
way it can be lifted with tools with great ease
707
some have erred in teaching sculptors to measure the limbs of their
figures with threads as if they thought that these limbs were
equally round in every part where these threads were wound about
them
708
measurement and division of a statue
divide the head into 12 degrees and each degree divide into 12
points and each point into 12 minutes and the minutes into minims
and the minims into semi minims
degreepointminuteminim
709
sculptured figures which appear in motion will in their standing
position actually look as if they were falling forward
footnote figure di rilievo leonardo applies this term
exclusively to wholly detached figures especially to those standing
free this note apparently refers to some particular case though we
have no knowledge of what that may have been if we suppose it to
refer to the first model of the equestrian statue of francesco
sforza see the introduction to the notes on sculpture this
observation may be regarded as one of his arguments for abandoning
the first scheme of the sforza monument in which the horse was to
be galloping see page 2 it is also in favour of this theory that
the note is written in a manuscript volume already completed in
1492 leonardos opinions as to the shortcomings of plastic works
when compared with paintings are given under no 655 and 656
notes on the casting of the sforza monument 710715
710
three braces which bind the mould
if you want to make simple casts quickly make them in a box of
river sand wetted with vinegar
when you shall have made the mould upon the horse you must make the
thickness of the metal in clay
observe in alloying how many hours are wanted for each
hundredweight in casting each one keep the furnace and its fire
well stopped up let the inside of all the moulds be wetted with
linseed oil or oil of turpentine and then take a handful of
powdered borax and greek pitch with aqua vitae and pitch the mould
over outside so that being under ground the damp may not damage
it
to manage the large mould make a model of the small mould make a
small room in proportion
make the vents in the mould while it is on the horse
hold the hoofs in the tongs and cast them with fish glue weigh the
parts of the mould and the quantity of metal it will take to fill
them and give so much to the furnace that it may afford to each
part its amount of metal and this you may know by weighing the clay
of each part of the mould to which the quantity in the furnace must
correspond and this is done in order that the furnace for the legs
when filled may not have to furnish metal from the legs to help out
the head which would be impossible cast at the same casting as
the horse the little door
footnote the importance of the notes included under this number is
not diminished by the fact that they have been lightly crossed out
with red chalk possibly they were the first scheme for some fuller
observations which no longer exist or perhaps they were crossed out
when leonardo found himself obliged to give up the idea of casting
the equestrian statue in the original the first two sketches are
above l 1 and the third below l 9
711
the mould for the horse
make the horse on legs of iron strong and well set on a good
foundation then grease it and cover it with a coating leaving each
coat to dry thoroughly layer by layer and this will thicken it by
the breadth of three fingers now fix and bind it with iron as may
be necessary moreover take off the mould and then make the
thickness then fill the mould by degrees and make it good
throughout encircle and bind it with its irons and bake it inside
where it has to touch the bronze
of making the mould in pieces
draw upon the horse when finished all the pieces of the mould with
which you wish to cover the horse and in laying on the clay cut it
in every piece so that when the mould is finished you can take it
off and then recompose it in its former position with its joins by
the countersigns
the square blocks a b will be between the cover and the core that
is in the hollow where the melted bronze is to be and these square
blocks of bronze will support the intervals between the mould and
the cover at an equal distance and for this reason these squares
are of great importance
the clay should be mixed with sand
take wax to return what is not used and to pay for what is used
dry it in layers
make the outside mould of plaster to save time in drying and the
expense in wood and with this plaster enclose the irons props
both outside and inside to a thickness of two fingers make terra
cotta and this mould can be made in one day half a boat load of
plaster will serve you
good
dam it up again with glue and clay or white of egg and bricks and
rubbish

introduzione della scultura that in preparing to cast bronze
statues horsedung was frequently used by sculptors if
notwithstanding this it remains doubtful whether i am justified in
having introduced here this text of but little interest no such
doubt can be attached to the sketch which accompanies it

it can also be made without a spring but the screw above must

the mint of rome footnote see pl lxxvi this passage is taken
from a note book which can be proved to have been used in rome
all coins which do not have the rim complete are not to be accepted
as good and to secure the perfection of their rim it is requisite
that in the first place all the coins should be a perfect circle
and to do this a coin must before all be made perfect in weight and
size and thickness therefore have several plates of metal made of
the same size and thickness all drawn through the same gauge so as
to come out in strips and out of 24 these strips you will stamp
the coins quite round as sieves are made for sorting chestnuts
27 and these coins can then be stamped in the way indicated
above c
31 the hollow of the die must be uniformly wider than the lower
but imperceptibly 35
this cuts the coins perfectly round and of the exact thickness and
weight and saves the man who cuts and weighs and the man who makes
the coins round hence it passes only through the hands of the
gauger and of the stamper and the coins are very superior

of taking casts of medals
a paste of emery mixed with aqua vitae or iron filings with
vinegar or ashes of walnut leaves or ashes of straw very finely
powdered
footnote the meaning of scagliuolo in this passage is doubtful
the diameter is given in the lead enclosed it is beaten with a
hammer and several times extended the lead is folded and kept
wrapped up in parchment so that the powder may not be spilt then
melt the lead and the powder will be on the top of the melted lead
which must then be rubbed between two plates of steel till it is
thoroughly pulverised then wash it with aqua fortis and the
blackness of the iron will be dissolved leaving the powder clean
emery in large grains may be broken by putting it on a cloth many
times doubled and hit it sideways with the hammer when it will
break up then mix it little by little and it can be founded with
ease but if you hold it on the anvil you will never break it when
it is large
any one who grinds smalt should do it on plates of tempered steel
with a cone shaped grinder then put it in aqua fortis which melts
away the steel that may have been worked up and mixed with the
smalt and which makes it black it then remains purified and clean
and if you grind it on porphyry the porphyry will work up and mix
with the smalt and spoil it and aqua fortis will never remove it
because it cannot dissolve the porphyry
if you want a fine blue colour dissolve the smalt made with tartar
and then remove the salt

stucco
place stucco over the prominence of the which may be composed
of venus and mercury and lay it well over that prominence of the
thickness of the side of a knife made with the ruler and cover this
with the bell of a still and you will have again the moisture with
which you applied the paste the rest you may dry margin note on
stucco 729 730 footnote in this passage a few words have been
written in a sort of cipherthat is to say backwards as in l 3

orreve co ecarob for il everro  co borace the meaning of the
word before di giesso in l 1 is unknown and the sense in
which sagoma is used here and in other passages is obscure
venere and mercurio may mean marble and lime of which
stucco is composed

well afterwards fire it and beat it or burnish it with a good
burnisher and make it thick towards the side
stucco
powder  with borax and water to a paste and make stucco of it
and then heat it so that it may dry and then varnish it with fire
so that it shines well

to cast bronze in plaster
take to every 2 cups of plaster 1 of oxhorns burnt mix them
together and make your cast with it

such as the mould is so will the cast be
737
how casts ought to be polished
make a bunch of iron wire as thick as thread and scrub them with
this and water hold a bowl underneath that it may not make a mud
below
how to remove the rough edges from bronze
make an iron rod after the manner of a large chisel and with this
rub over those seams on the bronze which remain on the casts of the
guns and which are caused by the joins in the mould but make the
tool heavy enough and let the strokes be long and broad
to facilitate melting
first alloy part of the metal in the crucible then put it in the
furnace and this being in a molten state will assist in beginning
to melt the copper
to prevent the copper cooling in the furnace
when the copper cools in the furnace be ready as soon as you
perceive it to cut it with a long stick while it is still in a
paste or if it is quite cold cut it as lead is cut with broad and
large chisels
if you have to make a large cast
if you have to make a cast of a hundred thousand pounds do it with
two furnaces and with 2000 pounds in each or as much as 3000 pounds
at most
738
how to proceed to break a large mass of bronze
if you want to break up a large mass of bronze first suspend it
and then make round it a wall on the four sides like a trough of
bricks and make a great fire therein when it is quite red hot give
it a blow with a heavy weight raised above it and with great force
739
to combine lead with other metal
if you wish for economy in combining lead with the metal in order to
lessen the amount of tin which is necessary in the metal first
alloy the lead with the tin and then add the molten copper
how to melt metal in a furnace
the furnace should be between four well founded pillars
of the thickness of the coating
the coating should not be more than two fingers thick it should be
laid on in four thicknesses over fine clay and then well fixed and
it should be fired only on the inside and then carefully covered
with ashes and cows dung
of the thickness of the gun
the gun being made to carry 600 ibs of ball and more by this rule
you will take the measure of the diameter of the ball and divide it
into 6 parts and one of these parts will be its thickness at the
muzzle but at the breech it must always be half and if the ball is
to be 700 lbs 17th of the diameter of the ball must be its
thickness in front and if the ball is to be 800 the eighth of its
diameter in front and if 900 18th and 12 316 and if 1000
19th
of the length of the body of the gun
if you want it to throw a ball of stone make the length of the gun
to be 6 or as much as 7 diameters of the ball and if the ball is
to be of iron make it as much as 12 balls and if the ball is to be
of lead make it as much as 18 balls i mean when the gun is to have
the mouth fitted to receive 600 lbs of stone ball and more
of the thickness of small guns
the thickness at the muzzle of small guns should be from a half to
one third of the diameter of the ball and the length from 30 to 36
balls
740
of luting the furnace within
the furnace must be luted before you put the metal in it with earth
from valenza and over that with ashes
footnote 1 2 terra di valenzavalenza is north of
alessandria on the po
of restoring the metal when it is becoming cool
when you see that the bronze is congealing take some willowwood cut
in small chips and make up the fire with it
the cause of its curdling
i say that the cause of this congealing often proceeds from too much
fire or from illdried wood
to know the condition of the fire
you may know when the fire is good and fit for your purpose by a
clear flame and if you see the tips of the flames dull and ending
in much smoke do not trust it and particularly when the flux metal
is almost fluid
of alloying the metal
metal for guns must invariably be made with 6 or even 8 per cent
that is 6 of tin to one hundred of copper for the less you put in
the stronger will the gun be
when the tin should be added to the copper
the tin should be put in with the copper when the copper is reduced
to a fluid
how to hasten the melting
you can hasten the melting when 23ds of the copper is fluid you
can then with a stick of chestnutwood repeatedly stir what of
copper remains entire amidst what is melted
introductory observations on the architectural designs xii and
writings on architecture xiii
until now very little has been known regarding leonardos labours
in the domain of architecture no building is known to have been
planned and executed by him though by some contemporary writers
incidental allusion is made to his occupying himself with
architecture and his famous letter to lodovico il morowhich has
long been a wellknown documentin which he offers his service as
an architect to that prince tends to confirm the belief that he was
something more than an amateur of the art this hypothesis has
lately been confirmed by the publication of certain documents
preserved at milan showing that leonardo was not only employed in
preparing plans but that he took an active part with much credit
as member of a commission on public buildings his name remains
linked with the history of the building of the cathedral at pavia
and that of the cathedral at milan
leonardos writings on architecture are dispersed among a large
number of mss and it would be scarcely possible to master their
contents without the opportunity of arranging sorting and comparing
the whole mass of materials so as to have some comprehensive idea
of the whole the sketches when isolated and considered by
themselves might appear to be of but little value it is not till
we understand their general purport from comparing them with each
other that we can form any just estimate of their true worth
leonardo seems to have had a project for writing a complete and
separate treatise on architecture such as his predecessors and
contemporaries had composedleon battista alberti filarete
francesco di giorgio and perhaps also bramante but on the other
hand it cannot be denied that possibly no such scheme was connected
with the isolated notes and researches treating on special
questions which are given in this work that he was merely working
at problems in which for some reason or other he took a special
interest
a great number of important buildings were constructed in lombardy
during the period between 1472 and 1499 and among them there are
several by unknown architects of so high an artistic merit that it
is certainly not improbable that either bramante or leonardo da
vinci may have been directly or indirectly concerned in their
erection
having been engaged for now nearly twenty years in a thorough
study of bramantes life and labours i have taken a particular
interest in detecting the distinguishing marks of his style as
compared with leonardos in 1869 i made researches about the
architectural drawings of the latter in the codex atlanticus at
milan for the purpose of finding out if possible the original
plans and sketches of the churches of santa maria delle grazie at
milan and of the cathedral at pavia which buildings have been
supposed to be the work both of bramante and of leonardo since 1876
i have repeatedly examined leonardos architectural studies in the
collection of his manuscripts in the institut de france and some of
these i have already given to the public in my work on les projets
primitifs pour la basilique de st pierre de rome p1 43 in 1879
i had the opportunity of examining the manuscript in the palazzo
trivulzio at milan and in 1880 dr richter showed me in london the
manuscripts in the possession of lord ashburnham and those in the
british museum i have thus had opportunities of seeing most of
leonardos architectural drawings in the original but of the
manuscripts tliemselves i have deciphered only the notes which
accompany the sketches it is to dr richters exertions that we owe
the collected texts on architecture which are now published and
while he has undertaken to be responsible for the correct reading of
the original texts he has also made it his task to extract the
whole of the materials from the various mss it has been my task to
arrange and elucidate the texts under the heads which have been
adopted in this work ms b at paris and the codex atlanticus at
milan are the chief sources of our knowledge of leonardo as an
architect and i have recently subjected these to a thorough
reinvestigation expressly with a view to this work
a complete reproduction of all leonardos architectural sketches
has not indeed been possible but as far as the necessarily
restricted limits of the work have allowed the utmost completeness
has been aimed at and no efforts have been spared to include every
thing that can contribute to a knowledge of leonardos style it
would have been very interesting if it had been possible to give
some general account at least of leonardos work and studies in
engineering fortification canalmaking and the like and it is
only on mature reflection that we have reluctantly abandoned this
idea leonardos occupations in these departments have by no means
so close a relation to literary work in the strict sense of the
word as we are fairly justified in attributing to his numerous notes
on architecture
leonardos architectural studies fall naturally under two heads
i those drawings and sketches often accompanied by short remarks
and explanations which may be regarded as designs for buildings or
monuments intended to be built with these there are occasionally
explanatory texts
ii theoretical investigations and treatises a special interest
attaches to these because they discuss a variety of questions which
are of practical importance to this day leonardos theory as to the
origin and progress of cracks in buildings is perhaps to be
considered as unique in its way in the literature of architecture

there be an arcade 6 braccia broad on columns and understand that
he who would go through the whole place by the high level streets
can use them for this purpose and he who would go by the low level
can do the same by the high streets no vehicles and similar objects
should circulate but they are exclusively for the use of gentlemen

the pavilion in the garden of the duchess of milan

footnote this passage was first published by amoretti in memorie
storiche cap x una sua opera da riportarsi a quest anno fu il
bagno fatto per la duchessa beatrice nel parco o giardino del
castello lionardo non solo ne disegno il piccolo edifizio a foggia
di padiglione nel cod segnato q 3 dandone anche separatamente la
pianta ma sotto vi scrisse padiglione del giardino della duchessa
e sotto la pianta fondamento del padiglione che nel mezzo del
labirinto del duca di milano nessuna data e presso il padiglione
disegnato nella pagina 12 ma poco sopra fra molti circoli
intrecciati vedesi  10 luglio 1492  e nella pagina 2 presso ad
alcuni disegni di legumi qualcheduno ha letto settembre 1482 in vece
di 1492 come dovea scriverevi e probabilmente scrisse lionardo
the original text however hardly bears the interpretation put upon
it by amoretti he is mistaken as to the mark on the ms as well as
in his statements as to the date for the ms in question has no
date the date he gives occurs on the contrary in another
notebook finally it appears to me quite an open question whether
leonardo was the architect who carried out the construction of the
domelike pavilion here shown in section or of the ground plan of
the pavilion drawn by the side of it must we in fact suppose that
il duca di milano here mentioned was as has been generally
assumed ludovico il moro he did not hold this title from the
emperor before 1494 till that date he was only called governatore
and leonardo in speaking of him mentions him generally as il
moro even after 1494 on january 18 1491 he married beatrice
deste the daughter of ercole i duke of ferrara she died on the
2nd january 1497 and for the reasons i have given it seems
improbable that it should be this princess who is here spoken of as
the duchessa di milano from the style of the handwriting it
appears to me to be beyond all doubt that the ms b from which this
passage is taken is older than the dated mss of 1492 and 1493 in
that case the duke of milan here mentioned would be gian galeazzo
14691494 and the duchess would be his wife isabella of aragon to
whom he was married on the second february 1489 j p r

iv ecclesiastical architecture
a general observations
753
a building should always be detached on all sides so that its form
may be seen
footnote the original text is reproduced on pl xcii no 1 to the
left hand at the bottom
754
here there cannot and ought not to be any campanile on the
contrary it must stand apart like that of the cathedral and of san
giovanni at florence and of the cathedral at pisa where the
campanile is quite detached as well as the dome thus each can
display its own perfection if however you wish to join it to the
church make the lantern serve for the campanile as in the church at
chiaravalle
footnote this text is written by the side of the plan given on pl
xci no 2
footnote 12 the abbey of chiaravalle a few miles from milan has
a central tower on the intersection of the cross in the style of
that of the certosa of pavia but the style is mediaeval a d
1330 leonardo seems here to mean that in a building in which the
circular form is strongly conspicuous the campanile must either be
separated or rise from the centre of the building and therefore
take the form of a lantern
755
it never looks well to see the roofs of a church they should rather
be flat and the water should run off by gutters made in the frieze
footnote this text is to the left of the domed church reproduced
on pl lxxxvii no 2
b the theory of dome architecture
this subject has been more extensively treated by leonardo in
drawings than in writing still we may fairly assume that it was his
purpose ultimately to embody the results of his investigation in a
trattato delle cupole the amount of materials is remarkably
extensive ms b is particularly rich in plans and elevations of
churches with one or more domesfrom the simplest form to the most
complicated that can be imagined considering the evident connexion
between a great number of these sketches as well as the
impossibility of seeing in them designs or preparatory sketches for
any building intended to be erected the conclusion is obvious that
they were not designed for any particular monument but were
theoretical and ideal researches made in order to obtain a clear
understanding of the laws which must govern the construction of a
great central dome with smaller ones grouped round it and with or
without the addition of spires so that each of these parts by
itself and in its juxtaposition to the other parts should produce
the grandest possible effect
in these sketches leonardo seems to have exhausted every imaginable
combination footnote 1 in ms b 32b see pl c iii no 2 we
find eight geometrical patterns each drawn in a square and in ms
ca fol 87 to 98 form a whole series of patterns done with the
same intention the results of some of these problems are perhaps
not quite satisfactory still they cannot be considered to give
evidence of a want of taste or of any other defect in leonardo s
architectural capacity they were no doubt intended exclusively for
his own instruction and before all as it seems to illustrate the
features or consequences resulting from a given principle
i have already in another place footnote 1 les projets
primitifs pour la basilique de st pierre de rome par bramante
raphael etcvol i p 2 pointed out the law of construction for
buildings crowned by a large dome namely that such a dome to
produce the greatest effect possible should rise either from the
centre of a greek cross or from the centre of a structure of which
the plan has some symmetrical affinity to a circle this circle
being at the same time the centre of the whole plan of the building
leonardos sketches show that he was fully aware as was to be
expected of this truth few of them exhibit the form of a latin
cross and when this is met with it generally gives evidence of the
determination to assign as prominent a part as possible to the dome
in the general effect of the building
while it is evident on the one hand that the greater number of
these domes had no particular purpose not being designed for
execution on the other hand several reasons may be found for
leonardos perseverance in his studies of the subject
besides the theoretical interest of the question for leonardo and
his trattato and besides the taste for domes prevailing at that
time it seems likely that the intended erection of some building of
the first importance like the duomos of pavia and como the church
of sta maria delle grazie at milan and the construction of a dome
or central tower tiburio on the cathedral of milan may have
stimulated leonardo to undertake a general and thorough
investigation of the subject whilst leonardos intercourse with
bramante for ten years or more can hardly have remained without
influence in this matter in fact now that some of this great
architects studies for s peters at rome have at last become
known he must be considered henceforth as the greatest master of
domearchitecture that ever existed his influence direct or
indirect even on a genius like leonardo seems the more likely since
leonardos sketches reveal a style most similar to that of bramante
whose name indeed occurs twice in leonardos manuscript notes it
must not be forgotten that leonardo was a florentine the
characteristic form of the two principal domes of florence sta
maria del fiore and the battisterio constantly appear as leading
features in his sketches
the church of san lorenzo at milan was at that time still intact
the dome is to this day one of the most wonderful cupolas ever
constructed and with its two smaller domes might well attract the
attention and study of a never resting genius such as leonardo a
whole class of these sketches betray in fact the direct influence of
the church of s lorenzo and this also seems to have suggested the
plan of bramantes dome of st peters at rome
in the following pages the various sketches for the construction of
domes have been classified and discussed from a general point of
view on two sheets pl lxxxiv ca 354b 118a and pl lxxxv
nos 111 ash ii 6b we see various dissimilar types grouped
together thus these two sheets may be regarded as a sort of
nomenclature of the different types on which we shall now have to
treat
1 churches formed on the plan of a greek cross
group i
domes rising from a circular base
the simplest type of central building is a circular edifice
pl lxxxiv no 9 plan of a circular building surrounded by a
colonnade
pl lxxxiv no 8 elevation of the former with a conical roof
pl xc no 5 a dodecagon as most nearly approaching the circle
pl lxxxvi no 1 2 3 four round chapels are added at the
extremities of the two principal axescompare this plan with fig
1 on p 44 and fig 3 on p 47 w p 5b where the outer wall is
octagonal
group ii
domes rising from a square base
the plan is a square surrounded by a colonnade and the dome seems
to be octagonal
pl lxxxiv the square plan below the circular building no 8 and
its elevation to the left above the plan here the groundplan is
square the upper storey octagonal a further development of this
type is shown in two sketches c a 3a not reproduced here and in
pl lxxxvi no 5 which possibly belongs to no 7 on pl lxxxiv
pl lxxxv no 4 and p 45 fig 3 a greek cross repeated p 45
fig 3 is another development of the square central plan
the remainder of these studies show two different systems in the
first the dome rises from a square planin the second from an
octagonal base
group iii
domes rising from a square base and four pillars footnote 1 the
ancient chapel san satiro via del falcone milan is a specimen of
this type
a first type a dome resting on four pillars in the centre of a
square edifice with an apse in the middle of each of the four
sides we have eleven variations of this type
aa pl lxxxviii no 3
bb pl lxxx no 5
cc pl lxxxv nos 2 3 5
dd pl lxxxiv no 1 and 4 beneath
ee pl lxxxv nos 1 7 10 11
b second type this consists in adding aisles to the whole plan of
the first type columns are placed between the apses and the aisles
the plan thus obtained is very nearly identical with that of s
lorenzo at milan
fig 1 on p 56 ms b 75a shows the result of this treatment
adapted to a peculiar purpose about which we shall have to say a few
words later on
pl xcv no 1 shows the same plan but with the addition of a short
nave this plan seems to have been suggested by the general
arrangement of s sepolcro at milan
ms b 57b see the sketch reproduced on p51 by adding towers in
the four outer angles to the last named plan we obtain a plan which
bears the general features of bramantes plans for s peters at
rome footnote 2 see les projets primitifs etc pl 912 see
p 51 fig 1
group iv
domes rising from an octagonal base
this system developed according to two different schemes has given
rise to two classes with many varieties
in a on each side of the octagon chapels of equal form are added
in b the chapels are dissimilar those which terminate the
principal axes being different in form from those which are added on
the diagonal sides of the octagon
a first class
the chapel degli angeli at florence built only to a height of
about 20 feet by brunellesco may be considered as the prototype of
this group and indeed it probably suggested it the fact that we
see in ms b 11b pl xciv no 3 by the side of brunellescos
plan for the basilica of sto spirito at florence a plan almost
identical with that of the capella degli angeli confirms this
supposition only two small differences or we may say improvements
have been introduced by leonardo firstly the back of the chapels
contains a third niche and each angle of the octagon a folded
pilaster like those in bramantes sagrestia di s m presso san
satiro at milan instead of an interval between the two pilasters
as seen in the battistero at florence and in the sacristy of sto
spirito in the same town and also in the above named chapel by
brunellesco
the first set of sketches which come under consideration have at
first sight the appearance of mere geometrical studies they seem to
have been suggested by the plan given on page 44 fig 2 ms b 55a
in the centre of which is written santa maria in perticha da
pavia at the place marked a on the reproduction
a ms b 34b page 44 fig 3 in the middle of each side a column
is added and in the axes of the intercolumnar spaces a second row
of columns forms an aisle round the octagon these are placed at the
intersection of a system of semicircles of which the sixteen
columns on the sides of the octagon are the centres
b the preceding diagram is completed and becomes more monumental in
style in the sketch next to it ms b 35a see p 45 fig 1 an
outer aisle is added by circles having for radius the distance
between the columns in the middle sides of the octagon
c ms b 96b see p 45 fig 2 octagon with an aisle round it
the angles of both are formed by columns the outer sides are formed
by 8 niches forming chapels the exterior is likewise octagonal
with the angles corresponding to the centre of each of the interior
chapels
pl xcii no 2 ms b 96b detail and modification of the
preceding planhalf columns against piersan arrangement by which
the chapels of the aisle have the same width of opening as the inner
arches between the half columns underneath this sketch the
following note occurs questo vole  avere 12 facce  co 12
tabernaculi  come  a  b this will have twelve sides with
twelve tabernacles as a b in the remaining sketches of this
class the octagon is not formed by columns at the angles
the simplest type shows a niche in the middle of each side and is
repeated on several sheets viz ms b 3 ms ca 354b see pl
lxxxiv no 11 and ms ash ii 6b see pl lxxxv no 9 and the
elevations no 8 pl xcii no 3 ms b 4b not reproduced here
and pl lxxxiv no 2
pl xcii 3 ms b 56b corresponds to a plan like the one in ms
b 35a in which the niches would be visible outside or as in the
following sketch with the addition of a niche in the middle of each
chapel
pl xc no 6 the niches themselves are surrounded by smaller
niches see also no 1 on the same plate

queste come le 8 cappele ano a essere facte this is how the
eight chapels are to be executed
c pl lxxxviii no 5 elevation to the plans on the same sheet it
is accompanied by the note ciasscuno de 9 tiburi nouole 
passare lalteza  di  2  quadri neither of the 9 domes must
exceed the height of two squares
d pl lxxxviii no 1 inside of the same octagon ms b 30a and
34b these are three repetitions of parts of the same plan with very
slight variations
d by a circular chapel
ms b 18a see fig 1 on page 47 gives the plan of this
arrangement in which the exterior is square on the ground floor with
only four of the chapels projecting as is explained in the next
sketch
pl lxxxix ms b 17b elevation to the preceding plan sketched on
the opposite side of the sheet and also marked a it is accompanied
by the following remark indicating the theoretical character of
these studies questo  edifitio  anchora  starebbe  bene
affarlo dalla linja  a  b  c  d  insu this edifice
would also produce a good effect if only the part above the lines a
b c d were executed
pl lxxxiv no 11 the exterior has the form of an octagon but the
chapels project partly beyond it on the left side of the sketch
they appear larger than on the right side
pl xc no 1 ms b 25b repetition of pl lxxxiv no 11
pl xc no 2 elevation to the plan no 1 and also to no 6 of the
same sheet
e by chapels formed by four niches
pl lxxxiv no 7 the circular plan on the left below shows this
arrangement in which the central dome has become circular inside and
might therefore be classed after this group footnote 1 this plan
and some others of this class remind us of the plan of the mausoleum
of augustus as it is represented for instance by durand see cab
des estampes bibliotheque nationale paris topographie de rome v
6 82
the sketch on the right hand side gives most likely the elevation
for the last named plan
f by chapels of still richer combinations which necessitate an
octagon of larger dimensions
pl xci no 2 ms ash 11 8b footnote 2 the note accompanying
this plan is given under no 754 on this plan the chapels
themselves appear to be central buildings formed like the first type
of the third group pl lxxxviii no 3
pl xci no 2 above the exterior of the preceding figure
particularly interesting on account of the alternation of apses and
niches the latter containing statues of a gigantic size in
proportion to the dimension of the niches
b second class
composite plans of this class are generally obtained by combining
two types of the first classthe one worked out on the principal
axes the other on the diagonal ones
ms b 22 shows an elementary combination without any additions on
the diagonal axes but with the dimensions of the squares on the two
principal axes exceeding those of the sides of the octagon
in the drawing w p 5b see page 44 fig 1 the exterior only of
the edifice is octagonal the interior being formed by a circular
colonnade round chapels are placed against the four sides of the
principal axes
the elevation drawn on the same sheet see page 47 fig 3 shows
the whole arrangement which is closely related with the one on pl
lxxxvi no 1 2
ms b 21a shows
a four sides with rectangular chapels crowned by pediments pl
lxxxvii no 3 plan and elevation
b four sides with square chapels crowned by octagonal domes pl
lxxxvii no 4 the plan underneath
ms b 18a shows a variation obtained by replacing the round chapels
in the principal axes of the sketch ms b l8a by square ones with
an apse leonardo repeated both ideas for better comparison side by
side see page 47 fig 2
pl lxxxix ms b 17b elevation for the preceding figure the
comparison of the drawing marked m with the plan on page 47 fig 2
bearing the same mark and of the elevation on pl lxxxix below
marked a with the corresponding plan on page 47 is highly
instructive as illustrating the spirit in which leonardo pursued
these studies
pl lxxxiv no 12 shows the design pl lxxxvii no 3 combined with
apses with the addition of round chapels on the diagonal sides
pl lxxxiv no 13 is a variation of the preceding sketch
pl xc no 3 ms b 25b the round chapels of the preceding sketch
are replaced by octagonal chapels above which rise campaniles
pl xc no 4 is the elevation for the preceding plan
pl xcii no 1 ms b 39b the plan below on the principal as
well as on the diagonal axes are diagonal chapels but the latter
are separated from the dome by semicircular recesses the
communication between these eight chapels forms a square aisle round
the central dome
above this figure is the elevation showing four campaniles on the
angles footnote 1 the note accompanying this drawing is
reproduced under no 753
pl lxxxiv no 3 on the principal axes are square chapels with
three niches on the diagonals octagonal chapels with niches cod
atl 340b gives a somewhat similar arrangement
ms b 30 the principal development is thrown on the diagonal axes
by square chapels with three niches on the principal axes are inner
recesses communicating with outer ones
the plan pl xciii no 2 ms b 22 differs from this only in so
far as the outer semicircles have become circular chapels
projecting from the external square as apses one of them serves as
the entrance by a semicircular portico
the elevation is drawn on the left side of the plan
ms b 19 a further development of ms b 18 by employing for the
four principal chapels the type pl lxxxviii no 3 as we have
already seen in pl xci no 2 the exterior presents two varieties
a the outer contour follows the inner footnote 2 these chapels
are here sketched in two different sizes it is the smaller type
which is thus formed
b it is semicircular
pl lxxxvii no 2 ms b 18b elevation to the first variation ms
b 19 if we were not certain that this sketch was by leonardo we
might feel tempted to take it as a study by bramante for st peters
at rome footnote 3 see les projets primitifs pl 43
ms p v 39b in the principal axes the chapels of ms b 19 and
semicircular niches on the diagonals the exterior of the whole
edifice is also an octagon concealing the form of the interior
chapels but with its angles on their axes
group v
suggested by san lorenzo at milan
in ms c a 266 iib 8l2b there is a plan almost identical with
that of san lorenzo the diagonal sides of the irregular octagon are
not indicated
if it could be proved that the arches which in the actual church
exist on these sides in the first story were added in 1574 by
martimo bassi then this plan and the following section would be
still nearer the original state of san lorenzo than at present a
reproduction of this slightly sketched plan has not been possible
it may however be understood from pl lxxxviii no 3 by suppressing
the four pillars corresponding to the apses
pl lxxxvii no 1 shows the section in elevation corresponding with
the abovenamed plan the recessed chapels are decorated with large
shells in the halfdomes like the arrangement in san lorenzo but
with proportions like those of bramantes sacristy of santa maria
presso s satiro
ms c a 266 a sheet containing three views of exteriors of domes
on the same sheet there is a plan similar to the one abovenamed but
with uninterrupted aisles and with the addition of round chapels in
the axes compare pl xcvii no 3 and page 44 fig 1 perhaps a
reminiscence of the two chapels annexed to san lorenzoleonardo
has here sketched the way of transforming this plan into a latin
cross by means of a nave with side aisles
pl xci no 1 plan showing a type deprived of aisles and comprised
in a square building which is surrounded by a portico it is
accompanied by the following text
756
this edifice is inhabited accessible below and above like san
sepolcro and it is the same above as below except that the upper
story has the dome c d and the footnote the church of san
sepolcro at milan founded in 1030 and repeatedly rebuilt after the
middle of the xvith century still stands over the crypt of the
original structure lower has the dome a b and when you enter
into the crypt you descend 10 steps and when you mount into the
upper you ascend 20 steps which with 13 braccio for each make 10
braccia and this is the height between one floor of the church and
the other
above the plan on the same sheet is a view of the exterior by the
aid of these two figures and the description sections of the
edifice may easily be reconstructed but the section drawn on the
left side of the building seems not to be in keeping with the same
plan notwithstanding the explanatory note written underneath it
dentro il difitio di sopra interior of the edifice
abovefootnote 1 the small inner dome corresponds to a b on the
planit rises from the lower church into the upper above and
larger rises the dome c d the aisles above and below thus
correspond e di sopra come di sotto salvoche etc the only
difference is that in the section leonardo has not taken the
trouble to make the form octagonal but has merely sketched circular
lines in perspective j p r
before leaving this group it is well to remark that the germ of it
seems already indicated by the diagonal lines in the plans pl lxxxv
no 11 and no 7 we shall find another application of the same type
to the latin cross in pl xcvii no 3
2 churches formed on the plan of a latin cross

the plan of the latin cross we shall begin by describing them and
shall add a few observations
a studies after existing monuments

its subterranean part the crypt still corresponds with the
present state of this part of the church as i have ascertained by
visiting the crypt with this plan excepting the addition of a few
insignificant walls the state of this interesting part of the
church still conforms to leonardos sketch but in the vestibolo the
two columns near the entrance of the winding stairs are absent

accompanied by the following note
757
this building is inhabited below and above the way up is by the
campaniles and in going up one has to use the platform where the
drums of the four domes are and this platform has a parapet in
front and none of these domes communicate with the church but they
are quite separate

and this sketch to suggest a direct connection between them
leonardo accompanied francesco di giorgiofootnote 3 see malaspina

21st 1490 as to this church the fact that the only word
accompanying the plan is sagrestia seems to confirm our
supposition for the sacristies were added only in 1492 i e four
years after the beginning of the cathedral which at that time was
most likely still sufficiently unfinished to be capable of receiving
the form of the present sketch

attention the designation of teatro given to some of these
sketches clearly shows which plan seemed to him most favourable for
hearing the preachers voice

d design for a mausoleum
pl xcviii p v 182 no dordre 2386 in the midst of a hilly
landscape rises an artificial mountain in the form of a gigantic
cone crowned by an imposing temple at two thirds of the height a
terrace is cut out with six doorways forming entrances to galleries
each leading to three sepulchral halls so constructed as to contain
about five hundred funeral urns disposed in the customary antique
style from two opposite sides steps ascend to the terrace in a
single flight and beyond it to the temple above a large circular
opening like that in the pantheon is in the dome above what may be
the altar or perhaps the central monument on the level of the
terrace below
the section of a gallery given in the sketch to the right below
shows the roof to be constructed on the principle of superimposed
horizontal layers projecting one beyond the other and each
furnished with a sort of heel which appears to be undercut so as
to give the appearance of a beam from within granite alone would be
adequate to the dimensions here given to the key stone as the
thickness of the layers can hardly be considered to be less than a
foot in taking this as the basis of our calculation for the
dimensions of the whole construction the width of the chamber would
be about 25 feet but judging from the number of urns it
containsand there is no reason to suppose that these urns were
larger than usualit would seem to be no more than about 8 or 10
feet
the construction of the vaults resembles those in the galleries of
some etruscan tumuli for instance the regulini galeassi tomb at
cervetri lately discovered and also that of the chamber and
passages of the pyramid of cheops and of the treasury of atreus at
mycenae
the upper cone displays not only analogies with the monuments
mentioned in the note but also with etruscan tumuli such as the
cocumella tomb at vulci and the regulini galeassi tombfootnote 1
see fersguson handbook of architecture i 291 the whole
scheme is one of the most magnificent in the history of
architecture
it would be difficult to decide as to whether any monument he had
seen suggested this idea to leonardo but it is worth while to
enquire if any monument or group of monuments of an earlier date
may be supposed to have done sofootnote 2 there are in
algiers two monuments commonly called le madracen and le
tombeau de la chretienne which somewhat resemble leonardos

bossi hazarded the theory that leonardo might have been the
architect who built the church of sta maria delle grazie but there
is no evidence to support this either in documents or in the
materials supplied by leonardos manuscripts and drawings the sketch
given at the side shows the arrangement of the second and third
socle on the apses of the choir of that church and it is remarkable
that those sketches in ms s k m ii2 2a and ib occur with the
passage given in volume i as no 665 and 666 referring to the
composition of the last supper in the refectory of that church
f the project for lifting up the battistero of florence and
setting it on a basement
among the very few details vasari gives as to the architectural
studies of leonardo we read and among these models and designs
there was one by way of which he showed several times to many
ingenious citizens who then governed florence his readiness to lift
up without ruining it the church of san giovanni in florence the
battistero opposite the duomo in order to place under it the
missing basement with steps he supported his assertions with
reasons so persuasive that while he spoke the undertaking seemed
feasable although every one of his hearers when he had departed
could see by himself the impossibility of so vast an undertaking

be exaggerated i may refer here to some data given by libri

in the ms c a fol 293 there are two sketches which possibly
might have a bearing on this bold enterprise we find there a plan
of a circular or polygonal edifice surrounded by semicircular arches
in an oblique position these may be taken for the foundation of the
steps and of the new platform in the perspective elevation the same
edifice forming a polygon is shown as lifted up and resting on a
circle of inverted arches which rest on an other circle of arches in
the ordinary position but so placed that the inverted arches above
rest on the spandrels of the lower range
what seems to confirm the supposition that the lifting up of a
building is here in question is the indication of engines for
winding up such as jacks and a rack and wheel as the lifting
apparatus represented on this sheet does not seem particularly
applicable to an undertaking of such magnitude we may consider it
to be a first sketch or scheme for the engines to be used
g description of an unknown temple
759
twelve flights of steps led up to the great temple which was eight
hundred braccia in circumference and built on an octagonal plan at
the eight corners were eight large plinths one braccia and a half
high and three wide and six long at the bottom with an angle in
the middle on these were eight great pillars standing on the
plinths as a foundation and twenty four braccia high and on the
top of these were eight capitals three braccia long and six wide
above which were the architrave frieze and cornice four braccia and
a half high and this was carried on in a straight line from one
pillar to the next and so continuing for eight hundred braccia
surrounded the whole temple from pillar to pillar to support this
entablature there were ten large columns of the same height as the
pillars three braccia thick above their bases which were one
braccia and a half high
the ascent to this temple was by twelve flights of steps and the
temple was on the twelfth of an octagonal form and at each angle
rose a large pillar and between the pillars were placed ten columns
of the same height as the pillars rising at once from the pavement
to a height of twenty eight braccia and a half and at this height
the architrave frieze and cornice were placed which surrounded the
temple having a length of eight hundred braccia at the same height
and within the temple at the same level and all round the centre of
the temple at a distance of 24 braccia farther in are pillars
corresponding to the eight pillars in the angles and columns
corresponding to those placed in the outer spaces these rise to the
same height as the former ones and over these the continuous
architrave returns towards the outer row of pillars and columns

highly probable it refers to some ruin the enormous dimensions

bottom of the rack 3 braccia and the top of it 4 braccia now in
order to attain to what i promise that is to make this place
contrary to the general custom clean and neat as to the upper part
of the stable i e where the hay is that part must have at its

of the servants belonging to the stable the other two which reach

several of leonardos drawings of architectural details prove that
like other great masters of that period he had devoted his
attention to the study of the proportion of such details as every
organic being in nature has its law of construction and growth

law of proportion in architecture the following notes in leonardos
manuscripts refer to this subject

decoration or perhaps a pavilion for some hunting place or park

theoretical writings on architecture
leonardos original writings on the theory of architecture have come
down to us only in a fragmentary state still there seems to be no
doubt that he himself did not complete them it would seem that
leonardo entertained the idea of writing a large and connected book
on architecture and it is quite evident that the materials we
possess which can be proved to have been written at different
periods were noted down with a more or less definite aim and
purpose they might all be collected under the one title studies
on the strength of materials among them the investigations on the
subject of fissures in walls are particularly thorough and very
fully reported these passages are also especially interesting
because leonardo was certainly the first writer on architecture who
ever treated the subject at all here as in all other cases
leonardo carefully avoids all abstract argument his data are not
derived from the principles of algebra but from the laws of
mechanics and his method throughout is strictly experimental
though the conclusions drawn from his investigations may not have
that precision which we are accustomed to find in leonardos
scientific labours their interest is not lessened they prove at
any rate his deep sagacity and wonderfully clear mind no one
perhaps who has studied these questions since leonardo has
combined with a scientific mind anything like the artistic delicacy
of perception which gives interest and lucidity to his observations
i do not assert that the arrangement here adopted for the passages
in question is that originally intended by leonardo but their
distribution into five groups was suggested by the titles or
headings which leonardo himself prefixed to most of these notes
some of the longer sections perhaps should not to be in strict
agreement with this division have been reproduced in their entirety
in the place where they occur but the comparatively small amount of
the materials we possess will render them even so sufficiently
intelligible to the reader it did not therefore seem necessary or
desirable to subdivide the passages merely for the sake of strict
classification
the small number of chapters given under the fifth class treating
on the centre of gravity in roofbeams bears no proportion to the
number of drawings and studies which refer to the same subject only
a small selection of these are reproduced in this work since the
majority have no explanatory text
i
on fissures in walls
770
first write the treatise on the causes of the giving way of walls
and then separately treat of the remedies
parallel fissures constantly occur in buildings which are erected on
a hill side when the hill is composed of stratified rocks with an
oblique stratification because water and other moisture often
penetrates these oblique seams carrying in greasy and slippery soil
and as the strata are not continuous down to the bottom of the
valley the rocks slide in the direction of the slope and the
motion does not cease till they have reached the bottom of the
valley carrying with them as though in a boat that portion of the
building which is separated by them from the rest the remedy for
this is always to build thick piers under the wall which is
slipping with arches from one to another and with a good scarp and
let the piers have a firm foundation in the strata so that they may
not break away from them
in order to find the solid part of these strata it is necessary to
make a shaft at the foot of the wall of great depth through the
strata and in this shaft on the side from which the hill slopes
smooth and flatten a space one palm wide from the top to the bottom
and after some time this smooth portion made on the side of the
shaft will show plainly which part of the hill is moving
footnote see pl civ
771
the cracks in walls will never be parallel unless the part of the
wall that separates from the remainder does not slip down
what is the law by which buildings have stability
the stability of buildings is the result of the contrary law to the
two former cases that is to say that the walls must be all built up
equally and by degrees to equal heights all round the building
and the whole thickness at once whatever kind of walls they may be
and although a thin wall dries more quickly than a thick one it will
not necessarily give way under the added weight day by day and thus
16 although a thin wall dries more quickly than a thick one it
will not give way under the weight which the latter may acquire from
day to day because if double the amount of it dries in one day one
of double the thickness will dry in two days or thereabouts thus
the small addition of weight will be balanced by the smaller
difference of time 18
the adversary says that a which projects slips down
and here the adversary says that r slips and not c
how to prognosticate the causes of cracks in any sort of wall
the part of the wall which does not slip is that in which the
obliquity projects and overhangs the portion which has parted from
it and slipped down
on the situation of foundations and in what places they are a cause
of ruin
when the crevice in the wall is wider at the top than at the bottom
it is a manifest sign that the cause of the fissure in the wall is
remote from the perpendicular line through the crevice

of cracks in walls which are wide at the bottom and narrow at the
top and of their causes
that wall which does not dry uniformly in an equal time always
cracks
a wall though of equal thickness will not dry with equal quickness
if it is not everywhere in contact with the same medium thus if
one side of a wall were in contact with a damp slope and the other
were in contact with the air then this latter side would remain of
the same size as before that side which dries in the air will
shrink or diminish and the side which is kept damp will not dry and
the dry portion will break away readily from the damp portion
because the damp part not shrinking in the same proportion does not
cohere and follow the movement of the part which dries continuously
of arched cracks wide at the top and narrow below
arched cracks wide at the top and narrow below are found in
walledup doors which shrink more in their height than in their
breadth and in proportion as their height is greater than their
width and as the joints of the mortar are more numerous in the
height than in the width
the crack diminishes less in r o than in m n in proportion as
there is less material between r and o than between n and m
any crack made in a concave wall is wide below and narrow at the
top and this originates as is here shown at b c d in the side
figure
1 that which gets wet increases in proportion to the moisture it
imbibes
2 and a wet object shrinks while drying in proportion to the
amount of moisture which evaporates from it

773
of the causes of fissures in the walls of public and private
buildings
the walls give way in cracks some of which are more or less
vertical and others are oblique the cracks which are in a vertical
direction are caused by the joining of new walls with old walls
whether straight or with indentations fitting on to those of the old
wall for as these indentations cannot bear the too great weight of
the wall added on to them it is inevitable that they should break
and give way to the settling of the new wall which will shrink one
braccia in every ten more or less according to the greater or
smaller quantity of mortar used between the stones of the masonry
and whether this mortar is more or less liquid and observe that
the walls should always be built first and then faced with the
stones intended to face them for if you do not proceed thus since
the wall settles more than the stone facing the projections left on
the sides of the wall must inevitably give way because the stones
used for facing the wall being larger than those over which they are
laid they will necessarily have less mortar laid between the
joints and consequently they settle less and this cannot happen if
the facing is added after the wall is dry
a b the new wall c the old wall which has already settled and
the part a b settles afterwards although a being founded on
c the old wall cannot possibly break having a stable foundation
on the old wall but only the remainder b of the new wall will
break away because it is built from top to bottom of the building
and the remainder of the new wall will overhang the gap above the
wall that has sunk
774
a new tower founded partly on old masonry
775
of stones which disjoin themselves from their mortar
stones laid in regular courses from bottom to top and built up with
an equal quantity of mortar settle equally throughout when the
moisture that made the mortar soft evaporates
by what is said above it is proved that the small extent of the new
wall between a and n will settle but little in proportion to
the extent of the same wall between c and d the proportion will
in fact be that of the thinness of the mortar in relation to the
number of courses or to the quantity of mortar laid between the
stones above the different levels of the old wall
footnote see pl cv no 1 the top of the tower is wanting in
this reproduction and with it the letter n which in the

776
this wall will break under the arch e f because the seven whole
square bricks are not sufficient to sustain the spring of the arch
placed on them and these seven bricks will give way in their middle
exactly as appears in a b the reason is that the brick a has
above it only the weight a k whilst the last brick under the arch
has above it the weight c d x a
c d seems to press on the arch towards the abutment at the point
p but the weight p o opposes resistence to it whence the whole
pressure is transmitted to the root of the arch therefore the foot
of the arch acts like 7 6 which is more than double of x z

on fissures in niches
777
on fissures in niches
an arch constructed on a semicircle and bearing weights on the two
opposite thirds of its curve will give way at five points of the
curve to prove this let the weights be at n m which will break
the arch a b f i say that by the foregoing as the
extremities c and a are equally pressed upon by the thrust n
it follows by the 5th that the arch will give way at the point
which is furthest from the two forces acting on them and that is the
middle e the same is to be understood of the opposite curve d g
b hence the weights n m must sink but they cannot sink by the
7th without coming closer together and they cannot come together
unless the extremities of the arch between them come closer and if
these draw together the crown of the arch must break and thus the
arch will give way in two places as was at first said c
i ask given a weight at a what counteracts it in the direction
n f and by what weight must the weight at f be counteracted
778
on the shrinking of damp bodies of different thickness and width
the window a is the cause of the crack at b and this crack is
increased by the pressure of n and m which sink or penetrate
into the soil in which foundations are built more than the lighter
portion at b besides the old foundation under b has already
settled and this the piers n and m have not yet done hence the
part b does not settle down perpendicularly on the contrary it
is thrown outwards obliquely and it cannot on the contrary be
thrown inwards because a portion like this separated from the main
wall is larger outside than inside and the main wall where it is
broken is of the same shape and is also larger outside than inside
therefore if this separate portion were to fall inwards the larger
would have to pass through the smallerwhich is impossible hence
it is evident that the portion of the semicircular wall when
disunited from the main wall will be thrust outwards and not
inwards as the adversary says
when a dome or a halfdome is crushed from above by an excess of
weight the vault will give way forming a crack which diminishes
towards the top and is wide below narrow on the inner side and wide
outside as is the case with the outer husk of a pomegranate
divided into many parts lengthwise for the more it is pressed in
the direction of its length that part of the joints will open most
which is most distant from the cause of the pressure and for that
reason the arches of the vaults of any apse should never be more
loaded than the arches of the principal building because that which
weighs most presses most on the parts below and they sink into the
foundations but this cannot happen to lighter structures like the
said apses

breadth which the cube above hanging in the air cannot do thus
it is proved the cube shown above is better shown here below
the final result of the two cylinders of damp clay that is a and
b will be the pyramidal figures below c and d this is proved
thus the cylinder a resting on block of stone being made of clay
mixed with a great deal of water will sink by its weight which
presses on its base and in proportion as it settles and spreads all
the parts will be somewhat nearer to the base because that is
charged with the whole weight
iii
on the nature of the arch
779
what is an arch
the arch is nothing else than a force originated by two weaknesses
for the arch in buildings is composed of two segments of a circle
each of which being very weak in itself tends to fall but as each
opposes this tendency in the other the two weaknesses combine to
form one strength
of the kind of pressure in arches
as the arch is a composite force it remains in equilibrium because
the thrust is equal from both sides and if one of the segments
weighs more than the other the stability is lost because the
greater pressure will outweigh the lesser
of distributing the pressure above an arch
next to giving the segments of the circle equal weight it is
necessary to load them equally or you will fall into the same
defect as before
where an arch breaks
an arch breaks at the part which lies below half way from the
centre
second rupture of the arch
if the excess of weight be placed in the middle of the arch at the
point a that weight tends to fall towards b and the arch
breaks at 23 of its height at c e and g e is as many times
stronger than e a as m o goes into m n
on another cause of ruin
the arch will likewise give way under a transversal thrust for when
the charge is not thrown directly on the foot of the arch the arch
lasts but a short time
780
on the strength of the arch
the way to give stability to the arch is to fill the spandrils with
good masonry up to the level of its summit
on the loading of round arches
on the proper manner of loading the pointed arch
on the evil effects of loading the pointed arch directly above its
crown
on the damage done to the pointed arch by throwing the pressure on
the flanks
an arch of small curve is safe in itself but if it be heavily
charged it is necessary to strengthen the flanks well an arch of a
very large curve is weak in itself and stronger if it be charged
and will do little harm to its abutments and its places of giving
way are o p
footnote inside the large figure on the righi is the note da
pesare la forza dell archo
781
on the remedy for earthquakes
the arch which throws its pressure perpendicularly on the abutments
will fulfil its function whatever be its direction upside down
sideways or upright
the arch will not break if the chord of the outer arch does not
touch the inner arch this is manifest by experience because
whenever the chord a o n of the outer arch n r a approaches the
inner arch x b y the arch will be weak and it will be weaker in
proportion as the inner arch passes beyond that chord when an arch
is loaded only on one side the thrust will press on the top of the
other side and be transmitted to the spring of the arch on that
side and it will break at a point half way between its two
extremes where it is farthest from the chord
782
a continuous body which has been forcibly bent into an arch thrusts
in the direction of the straight line which it tends to recover
783
in an arch judiciously weighted the thrust is oblique so that the
triangle c n b has no weight upon it
784
i here ask what weight will be needed to counterpoise and resist the
tendency of each of these arches to give way
footnote the two lower sketches are taken from the ms s k m
iii 10a they have there no explanatory text
785
on the strength of the arch in architecture
the stability of the arch built by an architect resides in the tie
and in the flanks
on the position of the tie in the above named arch
the position of the tie is of the same importance at the beginning
of the arch and at the top of the perpendicular pier on which it
rests this is proved by the 2nd of supports which says that part
of a support has least resistance which is farthest from its solid
attachment hence as the top of the pier is farthest from the
middle of its true foundation and the same being the case at the
opposite extremities of the arch which are the points farthest from
the middle which is really its upper attachment we have
concluded that the tie a b requires to be in such a position as
that its opposite ends are between the four abovementioned
extremes
the adversary says that this arch must be more than half a circle
and that then it will not need a tie because then the ends will not
thrust outwards but inwards as is seen in the excess at a c b
d to this it must be answered that this would be a very poor
device for three reasons the first refers to the strength of the
arch since it is proved that the circular parallel being composed
of two semicircles will only break where these semicircles cross
each other as is seen in the figure n m besides this it follows
that there is a wider space between the extremes of the semicircle
than between the plane of the walls the third reason is that the
weight placed to counterbalance the strength of the arch diminishes
in proportion as the piers of the arch are wider than the space
between the piers fourthly in proportion as the parts at c a b d
turn outwards the piers are weaker to support the arch above them
the 5th is that all the material and weight of the arch which are in
excess of the semicircle are useless and indeed mischievous and
here it is to be noted that the weight placed above the arch will be
more likely to break the arch at a b where the curve of the
excess begins that is added to the semicircle than if the pier were
straight up to its junction with the semicircle spring of the
arch
an arch loaded over the crown will give way at the left hand and
right hand quarters
this is proved by the 7th of this which says the opposite ends of
the support are equally pressed upon by the weight suspended to
them hence the weight shown at f is felt at b c that is half
at each extremity and by the third which says in a support of
equal strength throughout that portion will give way soonest which
is farthest from its attachment whence it follows that d being
equally distant from f e 
if the centering of the arch does not settle as the arch settles
the mortar as it dries will shrink and detach itself from the
bricks between which it was laid to keep them together and as it
thus leaves them disjoined the vault will remain loosely built and
the rains will soon destroy it
786
on the strength and nature of arches and where they are strong or
weak and the same as to columns
that part of the arch which is nearer to the horizontal offers least
resistance to the weight placed on it
when the triangle a z n by settling drives backwards the 23 of
each 12 circle that is a s and in the same way z m the reason
is that a is perpendicularly over b and so likewise z is above
f
either half of an arch if overweighted will break at 23 of its
height the point which corresponds to the perpendicular line above
the middle of its bases as is seen at a b and this happens
because the weight tends to fall past the point rand if
against its nature it should tend to fall towards the point s the
arch n s would break precisely in its middle if the arch n s
were of a single piece of timber if the weight placed at n should
tend to fall in the line n m the arch would break in the middle
of the arch e m otherwise it will break at one third from the top
at the point a because from a to n the arch is nearer to the
horizontal than from a to o and from o to s in proportion
as p t is greater than t n a o will be stronger than a n
and likewise in proportion as s o is stronger than o a r p
will be greater than p t
the arch which is doubled to four times of its thickness will bear
four times the weight that the single arch could carry and more in
proportion as the diameter of its thickness goes a smaller number of
times into its length that is to say that if the thickness of the
single arch goes ten times into its length the thickness of the
doubled arch will go five times into its length hence as the
thickness of the double arch goes only half as many times into its
length as that of the single arch does it is reasonable that it
should carry half as much more weight as it would have to carry if
it were in direct proportion to the single arch hence as this
double arch has 4 times the thickness of the single arch it would
seem that it ought to bear 4 times the weight but by the above rule
it is shown that it will bear exactly 8 times as much
that pier which is charged most unequally will soonest give way
the column c b being charged with an equal weight on each side
will be most durable and the other two outward columns require on
the part outside of their centre as much pressure as there is inside
of their centre that is from the centre of the column towards the
middle of the arch
arches which depend on chains for their support will not be very
durable
that arch will be of longer duration which has a good abutment
opposed to its thrust
the arch itself tends to fall if the arch be 30 braccia and the
interval between the walls which carry it be 20 we know that 30
cannot pass through the 20 unless 20 becomes likewise 30 hence the
arch being crushed by the excess of weight and the walls offering
insufficient resistance part and afford room between them for the
fall of the arch
but if you do not wish to strengthen the arch with an iron tie you
must give it such abutments as can resist the thrust and you can do
this thus fill up the spandrels m n with stones and direct the
lines of the joints between them to the centre of the circle of the
arch and the reason why this makes the arch durable is this we
know very well that if the arch is loaded with an excess of weight
above its quarter as a b the wall f g will be thrust outwards
because the arch would yield in that direction if the other quarter
b c were loaded the wall f g would be thrust inwards if it
were not for the line of stones x y which resists this
787
plan
here it is shown how the arches made in the side of the octagon
thrust the piers of the angles outwards as is shown by the line h
c and by the line t d which thrust out the pier m that is they
tend to force it away from the centre of such an octagon
788
an experiment to show that a weight placed on an arch does not
discharge itself entirely on its columns on the contrary the
greater the weight placed on the arches the less the arch transmits
the weight to the columns the experiment is the following let a
man be placed on a steel yard in the middle of the shaft of a well
then let him spread out his hands and feet between the walls of the
well and you will see him weigh much less on the steel yard give
him a weight on the shoulders you will see by experiment that the
greater the weight you give him the greater effort he will make in
spreading his arms and legs and in pressing against the wall and
the less weight will be thrown on the steel yard
iv
on foundations the nature of the ground and supports
789
the first and most important thing is stability
as to the foundations of the component parts of temples and other
public buildings the depths of the foundations must bear the same
proportions to each other as the weight of material which is to be
placed upon them
every part of the depth of earth in a given space is composed of
layers and each layer is composed of heavier or lighter materials
the lowest being the heaviest and this can be proved because these
layers have been formed by the sediment from water carried down to
the sea by the current of rivers which flow into it the heaviest
part of this sediment was that which was first thrown down and so
on by degrees and this is the action of water when it becomes
stagnant having first brought down the mud whence it first flowed
and such layers of soil are seen in the banks of rivers where their
constant flow has cut through them and divided one slope from the
other to a great depth where in gravelly strata the waters have run
off the materials have in consequence dried and been converted
into hard stone and this happened most in what was the finest mud
whence we conclude that every portion of the surface of the earth
was once at the centre of the earth and viceversa c
790
the heaviest part of the foundations of buildings settles most and
leaves the lighter part above it separated from it
and the soil which is most pressed if it be porous yields most
you should always make the foundations project equally beyond the
weight of the walls and piers as shown at m a b if you do as
many do that is to say if you make a foundation of equal width from
the bottom up to the surface of the ground and charge it above with
unequal weights as shown at b e and at e o at the part of the
foundation at b e the pier of the angle will weigh most and
thrust its foundation downwards which the wall at e o will not
do since it does not cover the whole of its foundation and
therefore thrusts less heavily and settles less hence the pier b
e in settling cracks and parts from the wall e o this may be
seen in most buildings which are cracked round the piers
791
the window a is well placed under the window c and the window
b is badly placed under the pier d because this latter is
without support and foundation mind therefore never to make a break
under the piers between the windows
792
of the supports
a pillar of which the thickness is increased will gain more than its
due strength in direct proportion to what its loses in relative
height
example
if a pillar should be nine times as high as it is broadthat is to
say if it is one braccio thick according to rule it should be nine
braccia highthen if you place 100 such pillars together in a mass
this will be ten braccia broad and 9 high and if the first pillar
could carry 10000 pounds the second being only about as high as it
is wide and thus lacking 8 parts of its proper length it that is
to say each pillar thus united will bear eight times more than
when disconnected that is to say that if at first it would carry
ten thousand pounds it would now carry 90 thousand
v
on the resistance of beams
793
that angle will offer the greatest resistance which is most acute
and the most obtuse will be the weakest
footnote the three smaller sketches accompany the text in the
original but the larger one is not directly connected with it it
is to be found on fol 89a of the same manuscript and there we read
in a note written underneath coverchio della perdicha del
castello roof of the flagstaff of the castlecompare also pl
xciii no 1
794
if the beams and the weight o are 100 pounds how much weight will
be wanted at ae to resist such a weight that it may not fall
down
795
on the length of beams
that beam which is more than 20 times as long as its greatest
thickness will be of brief duration and will break in half and
remember that the part built into the wall should be steeped in hot
pitch and filleted with oak boards likewise so steeped each beam
must pass through its walls and be secured beyond the walls with
sufficient chaining because in consequence of earthquakes the beams
are often seen to come out of the walls and bring down the walls and
floors whilst if they are chained they will hold the walls strongly
together and the walls will hold the floors again i remind you
never to put plaster over timber since by expansion and shrinking
of the timber produced by damp and dryness such floors often crack
and once cracked their divisions gradually produce dust and an ugly
effect again remember not to lay a floor on beams supported on
arches for in time the floor which is made on beams settles
somewhat in the middle while that part of the floor which rests on
the arches remains in its place hence floors laid over two kinds
of supports look in time as if they were made in hills footnote

rendering of this passage translating it thus les planchers qui
sont soutenus par deux differentes natures de supports paraissent

remarks on the style of leonardos architecture
a few remarks may here be added on the style of leonardos
architectural studies however incomplete however small in scale
they allow us to establish a certain number of facts and
probabilities well worthy of consideration
when leonardo began his studies the great name of brunellesco was
still the inspiration of all florence and we cannot doubt that
leonardo was open to it since we find among his sketches the plan
of the church of santo spiritofootnote 1 see pl xciv no 2 then
only in course of erection after the designs of brunellesco though
he was already dead finished in 1481 and a lateral view of san
lorenzo pl xciv no 1 a plan almost identical with the chapel
degli angeli only begun by him pl xciv no 3 while among
leonardos designs for domes several clearly betray the influence of
brunellescos cupola and the lantern of santa maria del
fiorefootnote 2 a small sketch of the tower of the palazzo della
signoria ms ca 309 proves that he also studied mediaeval
monuments
the beginning of the second period of modern italian architecture
falls during the first twenty years of leonardos life however the
new impetus given by leon battista alberti either was not generally
understood by his contemporaries or those who appreciated it had
no opportunity of showing that they did so it was only when taken
up by bramante and developed by him to the highest rank of modern
architecture that this new influence was generally felt now the
peculiar feature of leonardos sketches is that like the works of
bramante they appear to be the development and continuation of
albertis
but a question here occurs which is difficult to answer did
leonardo till he quitted florence follow the direction given by
the dominant school of brunellesco which would then have given rise
to his first manner or had he even before he left florence felt
albertis influenceeither through his works palazzo ruccellai
and the front of santa maria novella or through personal
intercourse or was it not till he went to milan that albertis work
began to impress him through bramante who probably had known
alberti at mantua about 1470 and who not only carried out albertis
views and ideas but by his designs for st peters at rome proved
himself the greatest of modern architects when leonardo went to
milan bramante had already been living there for many years one of
his earliest works in milan was the church of santa maria presso san
satiro via del falconefootnote 1 evidence of this i intend to
give later on in a life of bramante which i have in preparation
now we find among leonardos studies of cupolas on plates lxxxiv and
lxxxv and in pl lxxx several sketches which seem to me to have been
suggested by bramantes dome of this church
the mss b and ash ii contain the plans of s sepolcro the
pavilion in the garden of the duke of milan and two churches
evidently inspired by the church of san lorenzo at milan
ms b contains besides two notes relating to pavia one of them a
design for the sacristy of the cathedral at pavia which cannot be
supposed to be dated later than 1492 and it has probably some
relation to leonardos call to pavia june 21 1490footnote 2 the
sketch of the plan of brunellescos church of santo spirito at
florence which occurs in the same manuscript may have been done
from memory these and other considerations justify us in
concluding that leonardo made his studies of cupolas at milan
probably between the years 1487 and 1492 in anticipation of the
erection of one of the grandest churches of italy the cathedral of
pavia this may explain the decidedly lombardobramantesque tendency
in the style of these studies among which only a few remind us of
the forms of the cupolas of s maria del fiore and of the baptistery
of florence thus although when compared with bramantes work
several of these sketches plainly reveal that masters influence we
find among the sketches of domes some which show already
bramantes classic style of which the tempietto of san pietro in
montorio his first building executed at rome is the foremost
examplefootnote 3 it may be mentioned here that in 1494 bramante
made a similar design for the lantern of the cupola of the church of
santa maria delle grazie
on plate lxxxiv is a sketch of the plan of a similar circular
building and the mausoleum on pl xcviii no less than one of the
pedestals for the statue of francesco sforza pl lxv is of the
same type
the drawings pl lxxxiv no 2 pl lxxxvi no 1 and 2 and the ground
flour flour sic but should be floor  of the building in the
drawing pl xci no 2 with the interesting decoration by gigantic
statues in large niches are also i believe more in the style
bramante adopted at rome than in the lombard style are we to
conclude from this that leonardo on his part influenced bramante in
the sense of simplifying his style and rendering it more congenial
to antique art the answer to this important question seems at first
difficult to give for we are here in presence of bramante the
greatest of modern architects and with leonardo the man comparable
with no other we have no knowledge of any buildings erected by
leonardo and unless we admit personal intercoursewhich seems
probable but of which there is no proof it would be difficult to
understand how leonardo could have affected bramantes style the
converse is more easily to be admitted since bramante as we have
proved elsewhere drew and built simultaneously in different
manners and though in lombardy there is no building by him in his
classic style the use of brick for building in that part of italy
may easily account for it
bramantes name is incidentally mentioned in leonardos manuscripts
in two passages nos 1414 and 1448 on each occasion it is only a
slight passing allusion and the nature of the context gives us no
due information as to any close connection between the two artists
it might be supposed on the ground of leonardos relations with
the east given in sections xvii and xxi of this volume that some
evidence of oriental influence might be detected in his
architectural drawings i do not however think that any such traces
can be pointed out with certainty unless perhaps the drawing for a
mausoleum pl xc viii
among several studies for the construction of cupolas above a greek
cross there are some in which the forms are decidedly monotonous
these it is clear were not designed as models of taste they must
be regarded as the results of certain investigations into the laws
of proportion harmony and contrast
the designs for churches on the plan of a latin cross are
evidently intended to depart as little as possible from the form of
a greek cross and they also show a preference for a nave surrounded
with outer porticos
the architectural forms preferred by leonardo are pilasters coupled
pl lxxxii no 1 or grouped pl lxxx no 5 and xciv no 4 often
combined with niches we often meet with orders superposed one in
each story or two small orders on one story in combination with
one great order pl xcvi no 2
the drum tamburo of these cupolas is generally octagonal as in
the cathedral of florence and with similar round windows in its
sides in pl lxxxvii no 2 it is circular like the model actually
carried out by michael angelo at st peters
the cupola itself is either hidden under a pyramidal roof as in the
baptistery of florence san lorenzo of milan and most of the lombard
churches pl xci no 1 and pl xcii no 1 but it more generally
suggests the curve of sta maria del fiore pl lxxxviii no 5 pl
xc no 2 pl lxxxix m pl xc no 4 pl xcvi no 2 in other
cases pl lxxx no 4 pl lxxxix pl xc no 2 it shows the sides
of the octagon crowned by semicircular pediments as in
brunellescos lantern of the cathedral and in the model for the
cathedral of pavia
finally in some sketches the cupola is either semicircular or as
in pl lxxxvii no 2 shows the beautiful line adopted sixty years
later by michael angelo for the existing dome of st peters
it is worth noticing that for all these domes leonardo is not
satisfied to decorate the exterior merely with ascending ribs or
mouldings but employs also a system of horizontal parallels to
complete the architectural system not the least interesting are the
designs for the tiburio cupola of the milan cathedral they show
some of the forms just mentioned adapted to the peculiar gothic
style of that monument
the few examples of interiors of churches recall the style employed
in lombardy by bramante for instance in s maria di canepanuova at
pavia or by dolcebuono in the monastero maggiore at milan see pl
ci no 1 c a 181b 546b pl lxxxiv no 10
the few indications concerning palaces seem to prove that leonardo
followed albertis example of decorating the walls with pilasters
and a flat rustica either in stone or by graffitti pl cii no 1
and pl lxxxv no 14
by pointing out the analogies between leonardos architecture and
that of other masters we in no way pretend to depreciate his
individual and original inventive power these are at all events
beyond dispute the project for the mausoleum pl xcviii would
alone suffice to rank him among the greatest architects who ever
lived the peculiar shape of the tower pl lxxx of the churches
for preaching pl xcvii no 1 and pages 56 and 57 fig 14 his
curious plan for a city with high and low level streets pl lxxvii
and lxxviii no 2 and no 3 his loggia with fountains pl lxxxii
no 4 reveal an originality a power and facility of invention for
almost any given problem which are quite wonderful
in addition to all these qualities he propably stood alone in his
day in one department of architectural studyhis investigations
namely as to the resistance of vaults foundations walls and
arches
as an application of these studies the plan of a semicircular vault
pl ciii no 2 may be mentioned here disposed so as to produce no
thrust on the columns on which it rests volta i botte e non
ispignie ifori le colone above the geometrical patterns on the
same sheet close to a circle inscribed in a square is the note la
ragio duna volta cioe il terzo del diamitro della sua  del

there are few data by which to judge of leonardos style in the
treatment of detail on pl lxxxv no 10 and pl ciii no 3 we find
some details of pillars on pl ci no 3 slender pillars designed
for a fountain and on pl ciii no 1 ms b is a pen and ink drawing
of a vase which also seems intended for a fountain three handles
seem to have been intended to connect the upper parts with the base
there can be no doubt that leonardo like bramante but unlike
michael angelo brought infinite delicacy of motive and execution to
bear on the details of his work
xiv
anatomy zoology and physiology
leonardos eminent place in the history of medicine as a pioneer
in the sciences of anatomy and physiology will never be appreciated
till it is possible to publish the mass of manuscripts in which he
largely treated of these two branches of learning in the present
work i must necessarily limit myself to giving the reader a general
view of these labours by publishing his introductory notes to the
various books on anatomical subjects i have added some extracts
and such observations as are scattered incidentally through these
treatises as serving to throw a light on leonardos scientific
attitude besides having an interest for a wider circle than that of
specialists only
vasari expressly mentions leonardos anatomical studies having had
occasion to examine the manuscript books which refer to them
according to him leonardo studied anatomy in the companionship of
marc antonio della torre aiutato e scambievolmente
aiutandothis learned anatomist taught the science in the
universities first of padua and then of pavia and at pavia he and
leonardo may have worked and studied together we have no clue to
any exact dates but in the year 1506 marc antonio della torre seems
to have not yet left padua he was scarcely thirty years old when he
died in 1512 and his writings on anatomy have not only never been
published but no manuscript copy of them is known to exist
this is not the place to enlarge on the connection between leonardo
and marc antonio della torre i may however observe that i have not
been able to discover in leonardos manuscripts on anatomy any
mention of his younger contemporary the few quotations which occur
from writers on medicineeither of antiquity or of the middle ages
are printed in section xxii here and there in the manuscripts
mention is made of an anonymous adversary avversario whose
views are opposed and refuted by leonardo but there is no ground
for supposing that marc antonio della torre should have been this
adversary
only a very small selection from the mass of anatomical drawings
left by leonardo have been published here in facsimile but to form
any adequate idea of their scientific merit they should be compared
with the coarse and inadequate figures given in the published books
of the early part of the xvi century
william hunter the great surgeona competent judgewho had an
opportunity in the time of george iii of seeing the originals in
the kings library has thus recorded his opinion i expected to
see little more than such designs in anatomy as might be useful to a
painter in his own profession but i saw and indeed with
astonishment that leonardo had been a general and deep student
when i consider what pains he has taken upon every part of the body
the superiority of his universal genius his particular excellence
in mechanics and hydraulics and the attention with which such a man
would examine and see objects which he has to draw i am fully
persuaded that leonardo was the best anatomist at that time in the
world  leonardo was certainly the first man we know of who
introduced the practice of making anatomical drawings two
introductory letters london 1784 pages 37 and 39
the illustrious german naturalist johan friedrich blumenback
esteemed them no less highly he was one of the privileged few who
after hunter had the chance of seeing these manuscripts he writes
der scharfblick dieses grossen forschers und darstellers der natur
hat schon auf dinge geachtet die noch jahrhunderte nachher
unbemerkt geblieben sind see blumenbachs medicinische
bibliothek vol 3 st 4 1795 page 728
these opinions were founded on the drawings alone up to the present
day hardly anything has been made known of the text and for the
reasons i have given it is my intention to reproduce here no more
than a selection of extracts which i have made from the originals at
windsor castle and elsewhere in the bibliography of the
manuscripts at the end of this volume a short review is given of
the valuable contents of these anatomical note books which are at
present almost all in the possession of her majesty the queen of
england it is i believe possible to assign the date with
approximate accuracy to almost all the fragments and i am thus led
to conclude that the greater part of leonardos anatomical
investigations were carried out after the death of della torre
merely in reading the introductory notes to his various books on
anatomy which are here printed it is impossible to resist the
impression that the masters anatomical studies bear to a very great
extent the stamp of originality and independent thought

a general introduction
i wish to work miraclesit may be that i shall possess less than
other men of more peaceful lives or than those who want to grow
rich in a day i may live for a long time in great poverty as
always happens and to all eternity will happen to alchemists the
wouldbe creators of gold and silver and to engineers who would
have dead water stir itself into life and perpetual motion and to
those supreme fools the necromancer and the enchanter
footnote 23 the following seems to be directed against students of
painting and young artists rather than against medical men and
anatomists
and you who say that it would be better to watch an anatomist at
work than to see these drawings you would be right if it were
possible to observe all the things which are demonstrated in such
drawings in a single figure in which you with all your cleverness
will not see nor obtain knowledge of more than some few veins to
obtain a true and perfect knowledge of which i have dissected more
than ten human bodies destroying all the other members and
removing the very minutest particles of the flesh by which these
veins are surrounded without causing them to bleed excepting the
insensible bleeding of the capillary veins and as one single body
would not last so long since it was necessary to proceed with
several bodies by degrees until i came to an end and had a complete
knowledge this i repeated twice to learn the differences 59
footnote lines 159 and 6089 are written in two parallel columns
when we here find leonardo putting himself in the same category as
the alchemists and necromancers whom he elsewhere mocks at so
bitterly it is evidently meant ironically in the same way
leonardo in the introduction to the books on perspective sets
himself with transparent satire on a level with other writers on the
subject
and if you should have a love for such things you might be prevented
by loathing and if that did not prevent you you might be deterred
by the fear of living in the night hours in the company of those
corpses quartered and flayed and horrible to see and if this did
not prevent you perhaps you might not be able to draw so well as is
necessary for such a demonstration or if you had the skill in
drawing it might not be combined with knowledge of perspective and
if it were so you might not understand the methods of geometrical

of the order of the book
this work must begin with the conception of man and describe the
nature of the womb and how the foetus lives in it up to what stage
it resides there and in what way it quickens into life and feeds
also its growth and what interval there is between one stage of
growth and another what it is that forces it out from the body of
the mother and for what reasons it sometimes comes out of the
mothers womb before the due time
then i will describe which are the members which after the boy is
born grow more than the others and determine the proportions of a
boy of one year
then describe the fully grown man and woman with their proportions
and the nature of their complexions colour and physiognomy
then how they are composed of veins tendons muscles and bones
this i shall do at the end of the book then in four drawings
represent four universal conditions of men that is mirth with
various acts of laughter and describe the cause of laughter
weeping in various aspects with its causes contention with various
acts of killing flight fear ferocity boldness murder and every
thing pertaining to such cases then represent labour with pulling
thrusting carrying stopping supporting and such like things
further i would describe attitudes and movements then perspective
concerning the functions and effects of the eye and of
hearinghere i will speak of music and treat of the other
senses
and then describe the nature of the senses
this mechanism of man we will demonstrate in  figures of which
the three first will show the ramification of the bones that is
first one to show their height and position and shape the second
will be seen in profile and will show the depth of the whole and of
the parts and their position the third figure will be a
demonstration of the bones of the backparts then i will make three
other figures from the same point of view with the bones sawn
across in which will be shown their thickness and hollowness three
other figures of the bones complete and of the nerves which rise
from the nape of the neck and in what limbs they ramify and three
others of the bones and veins and where they ramify then three
figures with the muscles and three with the skin and their proper
proportions and three of woman to illustrate the womb and the
menstrual veins which go to the breasts
footnote the meaning of the word nervo varies in different
passages being sometimes used for muscolo muscle
798
the order of the book
this depicting of mine of the human body will be as clear to you as
if you had the natural man before you and the reason is that if you
wish thoroughly to know the parts of man anatomically youor your
eyerequire to see it from different aspects considering it from
below and from above and from its sides turning it about and
seeking the origin of each member and in this way the natural
anatomy is sufficient for your comprehension but you must
understand that this amount of knowledge will not continue to
satisfy you seeing the very great confusion that must result from
the combination of tissues with veins arteries nerves sinews
muscles bones and blood which of itself tinges every part the
same colour and the veins which discharge this blood are not
discerned by reason of their smallness moreover integrity of the
tissues in the process of the investigating the parts within them
is inevitably destroyed and their transparent substance being
tinged with blood does not allow you to recognise the parts covered
by them from the similarity of their bloodstained hue and you
cannot know everything of the one without confusing and destroying
the other hence some further anatomy drawings become necessary of
which you want three to give full knowledge of the veins and
arteries everything else being destroyed with the greatest care
and three others to display the tissues and three for the sinews
and muscles and ligaments and three for the bones and cartilages
and three for the anatomy of the bones which have to be sawn to
show which are hollow and which are not which have marrow and which
are spongy and which are thick from the outside inwards and which
are thin and some are extremely thin in some parts and thick in
others and in some parts hollow or filled up with bone or full of
marrow or spongy and all these conditions are sometimes found in
one and the same bone and in some bones none of them and three you
must have for the woman in which there is much that is mysterious
by reason of the womb and the foetus therefore by my drawings every
part will be known to you and all by means of demonstrations from
three different points of view of each part for when you have seen
a limb from the front with any muscles sinews or veins which take
their rise from the opposite side the same limb will be shown to
you in a side view or from behind exactly as if you had that same
limb in your hand and were turning it from side to side until you
had acquired a full comprehension of all you wished to know in the
same way there will be put before you three or four demonstrations
of each limb from various points of view so that you will be left
with a true and complete knowledge of all you wish to learn of the
human figurefootnote 35 compare pl cvii the original drawing at
windsor is 28 12 x 19 12 centimetres the upper figures are
slightly washed with indian ink on the back of this drawing is the
text no 1140
thus in twelve entire figures you will have set before you the
cosmography of this lesser world on the same plan as before me was
adopted by ptolemy in his cosmography and so i will afterwards
divide them into limbs as he divided the whole world into provinces
then i will speak of the function of each part in every direction
putting before your eyes a description of the whole form and
substance of man as regards his movements from place to place by
means of his different parts and thus if it please our great
author i may demonstrate the nature of men and their customs in
the way i describe his figure
and remember that the anatomy of the nerves will not give the
position of their ramifications nor show you which muscles they
branch into by means of bodies dissected in running water or in
lime water though indeed their origin and starting point may be
seen without such water as well as with it but their ramifications
when under running water cling and unitejust like flat or hemp
carded for spinningall into a skein in a way which makes it
impossible to trace in which muscles or by what ramification the
nerves are distributed among those muscles
799
the arrangement of anatomy
first draw the bones let us say of the arm and put in the motor
muscle from the shoulder to the elbow with all its lines then
proceed in the same way from the elbow to the wrist then from the
wrist to the hand and from the hand to the fingers
and in the arm you will put the motors of the fingers which open
and these you will show separately in their demonstration in the
second demonstration you will clothe these muscles with the
secondary motors of the fingers and so proceed by degrees to avoid
confusion but first lay on the bones those muscles which lie close
to the said bones without confusion of other muscles and with
these you may put the nerves and veins which supply their
nourishment after having first drawn the tree of veins and nerves
over the simple bones
800
begin the anatomy at the head and finish at the sole of the foot

when you have finished building up the man you will make the statue

footnote cresciere lomo the meaning of this expression appears
to be different here and in the passage ca 157a 468a see no
526 note 1 2 here it can hardly mean anything else than
modelling since the sculptor forms the figure by degrees by adding
wet clay and the figure consequently increases or grows tu farai
la statua would then mean you must work out the figure in marble
if this interpretation is the correct one this passage would have
no right to find a place in the series on anatomical studies i may
say that it was originally inserted in this connection under the
impression that di cresciere should be read descrivere
plans for the representation of muscles by drawings 803809
803
you must show all the motions of the bones with their joints to
follow the demonstration of the first three figures of the bones
and this should be done in the first book
804
remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle
you must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way
as to see that muscle move and where it is attached to the
ligaments of the bones
note
you will never get any thing but confusion in demonstrating the
muscles and their positions origin and termination unless you
first make a demonstration of thin muscles after the manner of linen
threads and thus you can represent them one over another as nature
has placed them and thus too you can name them according to the
limb they serve for instance the motor of the point of the great
toe of its middle bone of its first bone c and when you have
the knowledge you will draw by the side of this the true form and
size and position of each muscle but remember to give the threads
which explain the situation of the muscles in the position which
corresponds to the central line of each muscle and so these threads
will demonstrate the form of the leg and their distance in a plain
and clear manner
i have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that
the muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin
membrane in such a way that the sinews instead of merging in
muscles ended in wide membrane and where the bones were covered by
the skin they had very little over their natural size

physiology
comparative study of the organs of sense in men and animals
827
i have found that in the composition of the human body as compared
with the bodies of animals the organs of sense are duller and
coarser thus it is composed of less ingenious instruments and of
spaces less capacious for receiving the faculties of sense i have
seen in the lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with
part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils
which form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell which
enters by a great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several
passages leading up to where the brain as before said comes down
the eyes in the lion tribe have a large part of the head for their
sockets and the optic nerves communicate at once with the brain but
the contrary is to be seen in man for the sockets of the eyes are
but a small part of the head and the optic nerves are very fine and
long and weak and by the weakness of their action we see by day but
badly at night while these animals can see as well at night as by
day the proof that they can see is that they prowl for prey at
night and sleep by day as nocturnal birds do also
advantages in the structure of the eye in certain animals 828831
828
every object we see will appear larger at midnight than at midday
and larger in the morning than at midday
this happens because the pupil of the eye is much smaller at midday
than at any other time
in proportion as the eye or the pupil of the owl is larger in
proportion to the animal than that of man so much the more light
can it see at night than man can hence at midday it can see nothing
if its pupil does not diminish and in the same way at night
things look larger to it than by day
829
of the eyes in animals
the eyes of all animals have their pupils adapted to dilate and
diminish of their own accord in proportion to the greater or less
light of the sun or other luminary but in birds the variation is
much greater and particularly in nocturnal birds such as horned
owls and in the eyes of one species of owl in these the pupil
dilates in such away as to occupy nearly the whole eye or
diminishes to the size of a grain of millet and always preserves
the circular form but in the lion tribe as panthers pards
ounces tigers lynxes spanish cats and other similar animals the
pupil diminishes from the perfect circle to the figure of a pointed
oval such as is shown in the margin but man having a weaker sight
than any other animal is less hurt by a very strong light and his
pupil increases but little in dark places but in the eyes of these
nocturnal animals the horned owla bird which is the largest of
all nocturnal birdsthe power of vision increases so much that in
the faintest nocturnal light which we call darkness it sees with
much more distinctness than we do in the splendour of noon day at
which time these birds remain hidden in dark holes or if indeed
they are compelled to come out into the open air lighted up by the
sun they contract their pupils so much that their power of sight
diminishes together with the quantity of light admitted
study the anatomy of various eyes and see which are the muscles
which open and close the said pupils of the eyes of animals
footnote compare no 24 lines 8 and fol
830
a b n is the membrane which closes the eye from below upwards
with an opaque film c n b encloses the eye in front and behind
with a transparent membrane
it closes from below upwards because it the eye comes downwards
when the eye of a bird closes with its two lids the first to close
is the nictitating membrane which closes from the lacrymal duct over
to the outer corner of the eye and the outer lid closes from below
upwards and these two intersecting motions begin first from the
lacrymatory duct because we have already seen that in front and
below birds are protected and use only the upper portion of the eye
from fear of birds of prey which come down from above and behind
and they uncover first the membrane from the outer corner because
if the enemy comes from behind they have the power of escaping to
the front and again the muscle called the nictitating membrane is
transparent because if the eye had not such a screen they could
not keep it open against the wind which strikes against the eye in
the rush of their rapid flight and the pupil of the eye dilates and
contracts as it sees a less or greater light that is to say intense
brilliancy
831
if at night your eye is placed between the light and the eye of a
cat it will see the eye look like fire

834
of the nature of sight
i say that sight is exercised by all animals by the medium of
light and if any one adduces as against this the sight of
nocturnal animals i must say that this in the same way is subject
to the very same natural laws for it will easily be understood that
the senses which receive the images of things do not project from
themselves any visual virtue footnote 4 compare no 68 on the
contrary the atmospheric medium which exists between the object and
the sense incorporates in itself the figure of things and by its
contact with the sense transmits the object to it if the
objectwhether by sound or by odourpresents its spiritual force
to the ear or the nose then light is not required and does not act
the forms of objects do not send their images into the air if they
are not illuminated 8 and the eye being thus constituted cannot
receive that from the air which the air does not possess although
it touches its surface if you choose to say that there are many
animals that prey at night i answer that when the little light
which suffices the nature of their eyes is wanting they direct
themselves by their strong sense of hearing and of smell which are
not impeded by the darkness and in which they are very far superior
to man if you make a cat leap by daylight among a quantity of
jars and crocks you will see them remain unbroken but if you do the
same at night many will be broken night birds do not fly about
unless the moon shines full or in part rather do they feed between
sundown and the total darkness of the night

why men advanced in age see better at a distance
sight is better from a distance than near in those men who are
advancing in age because the same object transmits a smaller
impression of itself to the eye when it is distant than when it is
near
the seat of the common sense
836
the common sense is that which judges of things offered to it by
the other senses the ancient speculators have concluded that that
part of man which constitutes his judgment is caused by a central
organ to which the other five senses refer everything by means of
impressibility and to this centre they have given the name common
sense and they say that this sense is situated in the centre of the
head between sensation and memory and this name of common sense is
given to it solely because it is the common judge of all the other
five senses ie seeing hearing touch taste and smell this
common sense is acted upon by means of sensation which is placed as
a medium between it and the senses sensation is acted upon by means
of the images of things presented to it by the external instruments
that is to say the senses which are the medium between external
things and sensation in the same way the senses are acted upon by
objects surrounding things transmit their images to the senses and
the senses transfer them to the sensation sensation sends them to
the common sense and by it they are stamped upon the memory and are
there more or less retained according to the importance or force of
the impression that sense is most rapid in its function which is
nearest to the sensitive medium and the eye being the highest is
the chief of the others of this then only we will speak and the
others we will leave in order not to make our matter too long
experience tells us that the eye apprehends ten different natures of
things that is light and darkness one being the cause of the
perception of the nine others and the other its absence colour
and substance form and place distance and nearness motion and
stillness footnote 15 compare no 23
on the origin of the soul
837
though human ingenuity may make various inventions which by the
help of various machines answering the same end it will never
devise any inventions more beautiful nor more simple nor more to
the purpose than nature does because in her inventions nothing is
wanting and nothing is superfluous and she needs no counterpoise
when she makes limbs proper for motion in the bodies of animals but
she puts into them the soul of the body which forms them that is
the soul of the mother which first constructs in the womb the form
of the man and in due time awakens the soul that is to inhabit it
and this at first lies dormant and under the tutelage of the soul of
the mother who nourishes and vivifies it by the umbilical vein
with all its spiritual parts and this happens because this
umbilicus is joined to the placenta and the cotyledons by which the
child is attached to the mother and these are the reason why a
wish a strong craving or a fright or any other mental suffering in
the mother has more influence on the child than on the mother for
there are many cases when the child loses its life from them c
this discourse is not in its place here but will be wanted for the
one on the composition of animated bodiesand the rest of the
definition of the soul i leave to the imaginations of friars those
fathers of the people who know all secrets by inspiration
footnote 57 lettere incoronate by this term leonardo probably
understands not the bible only but the works of the early fathers
and all the books recognised as sacred by the roman church i leave
alone the sacred books for they are supreme truth
on the relations of the soul to the organs of sense
838
how the five senses are the ministers of the soul
the soul seems to reside in the judgment and the judgment would
seem to be seated in that part where all the senses meet and this
is called the common sense and is not allpervading throughout the
body as many have thought rather is it entirely in one part
because if it were allpervading and the same in every part there
would have been no need to make the instruments of the senses meet
in one centre and in one single spot on the contrary it would have
sufficed that the eye should fulfil the function of its sensation on
its surface only and not transmit the image of the things seen to
the sense by means of the optic nerves so that the soulfor the
reason given above may perceive it in the surface of the eye in
the same way as to the sense of hearing it would have sufficed if
the voice had merely sounded in the porous cavity of the indurated
portion of the temporal bone which lies within the ear without
making any farther transit from this bone to the common sense where
the voice confers with and discourses to the common judgment the
sense of smell again is compelled by necessity to refer itself to
that same judgment feeling passes through the perforated cords and
is conveyed to this common sense these cords diverge with infinite
ramifications into the skin which encloses the members of the body
and the viscera the perforated cords convey volition and sensation
to the subordinate limbs these cords and the nerves direct the
motions of the muscles and sinews between which they are placed
these obey and this obedience takes effect by reducing their
thickness for in swelling their length is reduced and the nerves
shrink which are interwoven among the particles of the limbs being
extended to the tips of the fingers they transmit to the sense the
object which they touch
the nerves with their muscles obey the tendons as soldiers obey the
officers and the tendons obey the common central sense as the
officers obey the general 27 thus the joint of the bones obeys
the nerve and the nerve the muscle and the muscle the tendon and
the tendon the common sense and the common sense is the seat of the
soul 28 and memory is its ammunition and the impressibility is
its referendary since the sense waits on the soul and not the soul
on the sense and where the sense that ministers to the soul is not
at the service of the soul all the functions of that sense are also
wanting in that mans life as is seen in those born mute and blind
footnote the peculiar use of the words nervo muscolo
corda senso comune which are here literally rendered by nerve
muscle cord or tendon and common sense may be understood from lines
27 and 28
on involuntary muscular action
839
how the nerves sometimes act of themselves without any commands from
the other functions of the soul

how the body of animals is constantly dying and being renewed
the body of any thing whatever that takes nourishment constantly
dies and is constantly renewed because nourishment can only enter
into places where the former nourishment has expired and if it has
expired it no longer has life and if you do not supply nourishment
equal to the nourishment which is gone life will fail in vigour
and if you take away this nourishment the life is entirely
destroyed but if you restore as much is destroyed day by day then
as much of the life is renewed as is consumed just as the flame of
the candle is fed by the nourishment afforded by the liquid of this
candle which flame continually with a rapid supply restores to it
from below as much as is consumed in dying above and from a
brilliant light is converted in dying into murky smoke and this
death is continuous as the smoke is continuous and the continuance
of the smoke is equal to the continuance of the nourishment and in
the same instant all the flame is dead and all regenerated
simultaneously with the movement of its own nourishment

death in old men when not from fever is caused by the veins which
go from the spleen to the valve of the liver and which thicken so
much in the walls that they become closed up and leave no passage
for the blood that nourishes it

veins thicken and become callous so that at last they close up and
prevent the passage of the blood

the waters return with constant motion from the lowest depths of the
sea to the utmost height of the mountains not obeying the nature of
heavier bodies and in this they resemble the blood of animated
beings which always moves from the sea of the heart and flows
towards the top of the head and here it may burst a vein as may be
seen when a vein bursts in the nose all the blood rises from below
to the level of the burst vein when the water rushes out from the
burst vein in the earth it obeys the law of other bodies that are
heavier than the air since it always seeks low places
footnote from this passage it is quite plain that leonardo had not
merely a general suspicion of the circulation of the blood but a
very clear conception of it leonardos studies on the muscles of
the heart are to be found in the ms w an iii but no information

astronomy
ever since the publication by venturi in 1797 and libri in 1840
of some few passages of leonardos astronomical notes scientific
astronomers have frequently expressed the opinion that they must
have been based on very important discoveries and that the great
painter also deserved a conspicuous place in the history of this
science in the passages here printed a connected view is given of
his astronomical studies as they lie scattered through the
manuscripts which have come down to us unlike his other purely
scientific labours leonardo devotes here a good deal of attention
to the opinions of the ancients though he does not follow the
practice universal in his day of relying on them as authorities he
only quotes them as we shall see in order to refute their
arguments his researches throughout have the stamp of independent
thought there is nothing in these writings to lead us to suppose
that they were merely an epitome of the general learning common to
the astronomers of the period as early as in the xivth century
there were chairs of astronomy in the universities of padua and
bologna but so late as during the entire xvith century astronomy
and astrology were still closely allied
it is impossible now to decide whether leonardo when living in
florence became acquainted in his youth with the doctrines of paolo
toscanelli the great astronomer and mathematician died 1482 of
whose influence and teaching but little is now known beyond the
fact that he advised and encouraged columbus to carry out his
project of sailing round the world his name is nowhere mentioned by
leonardo and from the dates of the manuscripts from which the texts
on astronomy are taken it seems highly probable that leonardo
devoted his attention to astronomical studies less in his youth than
in his later years it was evidently his purpose to treat of
astronomy in a connected form and in a separate work see the
beginning of nos 866 and 892 compare also no 1167 it is
quite in accordance with his general scientific thoroughness that he
should propose to write a special treatise on optics as an
introduction to astronomy see nos 867 and 877 some of the
chapters belonging to this section bear the title prospettiva
see nos 869 and 870 this being the term universally applied
at the time to optics as well as perspective see vol i p 10
note to no 13 l 10
at the beginning of the xvith century the ptolemaic theory of the
universe was still universally accepted as the true one and
leonardo conceives of the earth as fixed with the moon and sun
revolving round it as they are represented in the diagram to no
897 he does not go into any theory of the motions of the planets
with regard to these and the fixed stars he only investigates the
phenomena of their luminosity the spherical form of the earth he
takes for granted as an axiom from the first and he anticipates
newton by pointing out the universality of gravitation not merely in
the earth but even in the moon although his acute research into
the nature of the moons light and the spots on the moon did not
bring to light many results of lasting importance beyond making it
evident that they were a refutation of the errors of his
contemporaries they contain various explanations of facts which
modern science need not modify in any essential point and
discoveries which history has hitherto assigned to a very much later
date
the ingenious theory by which he tries to explain the nature of
what is known as earth shine the reflection of the suns rays by
the earth towards the moon saying that it is a peculiar refraction
originating in the innumerable curved surfaces of the waves of the
sea may be regarded as absurd but it must not be forgotten that he
had no means of detecting the fundamental error on which he based
it namely the assumption that the moon was at a relatively short
distance from the earth so long as the motion of the earth round
the sun remained unknown it was of course impossible to form any
estimate of the moons distance from the earth by a calculation of
its parallax
before the discovery of the telescope accurate astronomical
observations were only possible to a very limited extent it would
appear however from certain passages in the notes here printed for
the first time that leonardo was in a position to study the spots
in the moon more closely than he could have done with the unaided
eye so far as can be gathered from the mysterious language in which
the description of his instrument is wrapped he made use of
magnifying glasses these do not however seem to have been
constructed like a telescopetelescopes were first made about
1600 as libri pointed out histoire des sciences mathematiques

force arises from dearth or abundance it is the child of physical
motion and the grandchild of spiritual motion and the mother and
origin of gravity gravity is limited to the elements of water and
earth but this force is unlimited and by it infinite worlds might
be moved if instruments could be made by which the force could be
generated
force with physical motion and gravity with resistance are the
four external powers on which all actions of mortals depend
force has its origin in spiritual motion and this motion flowing
through the limbs of sentient animals enlarges their muscles being
enlarged by this current the muscles are shrunk in length and
contract the tendons which are connected with them and this is the
cause of the force of the limbs in man
the quality and quantity of the force of a man are able to give
birth to other forces which will be proportionally greater as the
motions produced by them last longer

how to prove that the earth is a planet 865867
865
that the earth is a star
866
in your discourse you must prove that the earth is a star much like
the moon and the glory of our universe and then you must treat of
the size of various stars according to the authors
867
the method of proving that the earth is a star
first describe the eye then show how the twinkling of a star is
really in the eye and why one star should twinkle more than another
and how the rays from the stars originate in the eye and add that
if the twinkling of the stars were really in the stars as it seems
to bethat this twinkling appears to be an extension as great as
the diameter of the body of the star therefore the star being
larger than the earth this motion effected in an instant would be a
rapid doubling of the size of the star then prove that the surface
of the air where it lies contiguous to fire and the surface of the
fire where it ends are those into which the solar rays penetrate
and transmit the images of the heavenly bodies large when they
rise and small when they are on the meridian let a be the earth
and n d m the surface of the air in contact with the sphere of
fire h f g is the orbit of the moon or if you please of the
sun then i say that when the sun appears on the horizon g its
rays are seen passing through the surface of the air at a slanting
angle that is o m this is not the case at d k and so it
passes through a greater mass of air all of e m is a denser
atmosphere

perspective
it is possible to find means by which the eye shall not see remote
objects as much diminished as in natural perspective which
diminishes them by reason of the convexity of the eye which
necessarily intersects at its surface the pyramid of every image
conveyed to the eye at a right angle on its spherical surface but
by the method i here teach in the margin 9 these pyramids are
intersected at right angles close to the surface of the pupil the
convex pupil of the eye can take in the whole of our hemisphere
while this will show only a single star but where many small stars
transmit their images to the surface of the pupil those stars are
extremely small here only one star is seen but it will be large
and so the moon will be seen larger and its spots of a more defined
form footnote 20 and fol telescopes were not in use till a century
later compare no 910 and page 136 you must place close to the
eye a glass filled with the water of which mention is made in number
4 of book 113 on natural substances footnote 23 libro 113
this is perhaps the number of a book in some library catalogue but
it may refer on the other hand to one of the 120 books mentioned
in no 796 l 84 for this water makes objects which are enclosed
in balls of crystalline glass appear free from the glass
of the eye
among the smaller objects presented to the pupil of the eye that
which is closest to it will be least appreciable to the eye and at
the same time the experiments here made with the power of sight
show that it is not reduced to speck if the c 32footnote 32
compare with this the passage in vol i no 52 written about
twenty years earlier
read in the margin
34those objects are seen largest which come to the eye at the
largest angles
but the images of the objects conveyed to the pupil of the eye are
distributed to the pupil exactly as they are distributed in the air
and the proof of this is in what follows that when we look at the
starry sky without gazing more fixedly at one star than another
the sky appears all strewn with stars and their proportions to the
eye are the same as in the sky and likewise the spaces between them

perspective
among objects moved from the eye at equal distance that undergoes
least diminution which at first was most remote
when various objects are removed at equal distances farther from
their original position that which was at first the farthest from
the eye will diminish least and the proportion of the diminution
will be in proportion to the relative distance of the objects from
the eye before they were removed
that is to say in the object t and the object e the proportion
of their distances from the eye a is quintuple i remove each from
its place and set it farther from the eye by one of the 5 parts into
which the proposition is divided hence it happens that the nearest
to the eye has doubled the distance and according to the last
proposition but one of this is diminished by the half of its whole
size and the body e by the same motion is diminished 15 of its
whole size therefore by that same last proposition but one that
which is said in this last proposition is true and this i say of
the motions of the celestial bodies which are more distant by 3500
miles when setting than when overhead and yet do not increase or
diminish in any sensible degree
871
a b is the aperture through which the sun passes and if you could
measure the size of the solar rays at n m you could accurately
trace the real lines of the convergence of the solar rays the
mirror being at a b and then show the reflected rays at equal
angles to n m but as you want to have them at n m take them
at the inner side of the aperture at cd where they maybe measured
at the spot where the solar rays fall then place your mirror at the
distance a b making the rays d b c a fall and then be
reflected at equal angles towards c d and this is the best
method but you must use this mirror always in the same month and
the same day and hour and instant and this will be better than at
no fixed time because when the sun is at a certain distance it
produces a certain pyramid of rays
872
a the side of the body in light and shade b faces the whole
portion of the hemisphere bed e f and does not face any part of

darker and how much must be demonstrated by calculation footnote
this passage which has perhaps a doubtful right to its place in
this connection stands in the manuscript between those given in

the reason of the increased size of the sun in the west
some mathematicians explain that the sun looks larger as it sets
because the eye always sees it through a denser atmosphere alleging
that objects seen through mist or through water appear larger to
these i reply no because objects seen through a mist are similar
in colour to those at a distance but not being similarly diminished
they appear larger again nothing increases in size in smooth
water and the proof of this may be seen by throwing a light on a
board placed half under water but the reason why the sun looks
larger is that every luminous body appears larger in proportion as
it is more remote footnote lines 5 and 6 are thus rendered by m

from this it follows that 2 footnote 10 here the text breaks

same page of the manuscript by a passage on whirlpools with the
diagram belonging to it also reproduced here the words della mia
prospettiva may therefore indicate that the diagram to the
preceding chapter treating on a heterogeneal subject is to be
excluded it is a further difficulty that this diagram belongs
properly to lines 910 and not to the preceding sentence the
reflection of the sun in water is also discussed in the theoretical
part of the book on painting see vol i no 206 207 and it will
cover more of the water in proportion as the reflected image is
remote from the eye 10
footnote in the original sketch inside the circle in the first

the image of the sun will be more brightly shown in small waves than
in large onesand this is because the reflections or images of the
sun are more numerous in the small waves than in large ones and the
more numerous reflections of its radiance give a larger light than
the fewer
waves which intersect like the scales of a fir cone reflect the
image of the sun with the greatest splendour and this is the case
because the images are as many as the ridges of the waves on which
the sun shines and the shadows between these waves are small and
not very dark and the radiance of so many reflections together
becomes united in the image which is transmitted to the eye so that
these shadows are imperceptible
that reflection of the sun will cover most space on the surface of
the water which is most remote from the eye which sees it
let a be the sun p q the reflection of the sun a b is the
surface of the water in which the sun is mirrored and r the eye
which sees this reflection on the surface of the water occupying the
space o m c is the eye at a greater distance from the surface
of the water and also from the reflection hence this reflection
covers a larger space of water by the distance between n and o
876
it is impossible that the side of a spherical mirror illuminated by
the sun should reflect its radiance unless this mirror were
undulating or filled with bubbles
you see here the sun which lights up the moon a spherical mirror
and all of its surface which faces the sun is rendered radiant
whence it may be concluded that what shines in the moon is water
like that of our seas and in waves as that is and that portion
which does not shine consists of islands and terra firma
this diagram of several spherical bodies interposed between the eye
and the sun is given to show that just as the reflection of the
sun is seen in each of these bodies in the same way that image may
be seen in each curve of the waves of the sea and as in these many
spheres many reflections of the sun are seen so in many waves there
are many images each of which at a great distance is much magnified
to the eye and as this happens with each wave the spaces
interposed between the waves are concealed and for this reason it
looks as though the many suns mirrored in the many waves were but
one continuous sun and the shadows mixed up with the luminous
images render this radiance less brilliant than that of the sun
mirrored in these waves

the sun is written and at o occhio the eye

this will have before it the treatise on light and shade

879
in praise of the sun
if you look at the stars cutting off the rays as may be done by
looking through a very small hole made with the extreme point of a
very fine needle placed so as almost to touch the eye you will
see those stars so minute that it would seem as though nothing could
be smaller it is in fact their great distance which is the reason
of their diminution for many of them are very many times larger
than the star which is the earth with water now reflect what this
our star must look like at such a distance and then consider how
many stars might be addedboth in longitude and latitudebetween
those stars which are scattered over the darkened sky but i cannot
forbear to condemn many of the ancients who said that the sun was
no larger than it appears among these was epicurus and i believe
that he founded his reason on the effects of a light placed in our
atmosphere equidistant from the centre of the earth any one looking
at it never sees it diminished in size at whatever distance and the
rea

of the physical properties of the sun and says that it is larger
than the earth

body of greater magnitude and power than the sun its light gives
light to all the celestial bodies which are distributed throughout
the universe and from it descends all vital force for the heat
that is in living beings comes from the soul vital spark and
there is no other centre of heat and light in the universe as will
be shown in book 4 and certainly those who have chosen to worship
men as godsas jove saturn mars and the likehave fallen into
the gravest error seeing that even if a man were as large as our
earth he would look no bigger than a little star which appears but
as a speck in the universe and seeing again that these men are
mortal and putrid and corrupt in their sepulchres

centuries a c the author of the treatise de compendiosa doctrina

epicurus perhaps saw the shadows cast by columns on the walls in
front of them equal in diameter to the columns from which the
shadows were cast and the breadth of the shadows being parallel
from beginning to end he thought he might infer that the sun also
was directly opposite to this parallel and that consequently its
breadth was not greater than that of the column not perceiving that
the diminution in the shadow was insensibly slight by reason of the
remoteness of the sun if the sun were smaller than the earth the
stars on a great portion of our hemisphere would have no light
which is evidence against epicurus who says the sun is only as large
as it appears
footnote in the original the writing is across the diagram
882
epicurus says the sun is the size it looks hence as it looks about
a foot across we must consider that to be its size it would follow
that when the moon eclipses the sun the sun ought not to appear the
larger as it does then the moon being smaller than the sun the
moon must be less than a foot and consequently when our world
eclipses the moon it must be less than a foot by a fingers
breadth inasmuch as if the sun is a foot across and our earth
casts a conical shadow on the moon it is inevitable that the
luminous cause of the cone of shadow must be larger than the opaque
body which casts the cone of shadow
883
to measure how many times the diameter of the sun will go into its
course in 24 hours
make a circle and place it to face the south after the manner of a
sundial and place a rod in the middle in such a way as that its
length points to the centre of this circle and mark the shadow cast
in the sunshine by this rod on the circumference of the circle and
this shadow will belet us say as broad as from a to n now
measure how many times this shadow will go into this circumference
of a circle and that will give you the number of times that the
solar body will go into its orbit in 24 hours thus you may see
whether epicurus was right in saying that the sun was only as
large as it looked for as the apparent diameter of the sun is
about a foot and as that sun would go a thousand times into the
length of its course in 24 hours it would have gone a thousand
feet that is 300 braccia which is the sixth of a mile whence it
would follow that the course of the sun during the day would be the
sixth part of a mile and that this venerable snail the sun will
have travelled 25 braccia an hour
884
posidonius composed books on the size of the sun footnote
poseidonius of apamea commonly called the rhodian because he
taught in rhodes was a stoic philosopher a contemporary and friend
of ciceros and the author of numerous works on natural science
among them
strabo quotes no doubt from one of his works when he says that
poseidonius explained how it was that the sun looked larger when it
was rising or setting than during the rest of its course iii p
135 kleomedes a later greek naturalist also mentions this
observation of poseidonius without naming the title of his work
however as kleomedes cyclia theorica was not printed till 1535
leonardo must have derived his quotation from strabo he probably
wrote this note in 1508 and as the original greek was first printed
in venice in 1516 we must suppose him to quote here from the
translation by guarinus veronensis which was printed as early as
1471 also at venice h mullerstrubing
of the nature of sunlight
885
of the proof that the sun is hot by nature and not by virtue
of the nature of sunlight
that the heat of the sun resides in its nature and not in its virtue
or mode of action is abundantly proved by the radiance of the
solar body on which the human eye cannot dwell and besides this no
less manifestly by the rays reflected from a concave mirror
whichwhen they strike the eye with such splendour that the eye
cannot bear themhave a brilliancy equal to the sun in its own
place and that this is true i prove by the fact that if the mirror
has its concavity formed exactly as is requisite for the collecting
and reflecting of these rays no created being could endure the
heat that strikes from the reflected rays of such a mirror and if
you argue that the mirror itself is cold and yet send forth hot
rays i should reply that those rays come really from the sun and
that it is the ray of the concave mirror after having passed through
the window

proof that the nearer you are to the source of the solar rays the
larger will the reflection of the sun from the sea appear to you
footnote lines 4 and fol compare vol i nos 130 131 if it is
from the centre that the sun employs its radiance to intensify the
power of its whole mass it is evident that the farther its rays
extend the more widely they will be divided and this being so
you whose eye is near the water that mirrors the sun see but a
small portion of the rays of the sun strike the surface of the
water and reflecting the form of the sun but if you were near to
the sunas would be the case when the sun is on the meridian and
the sea to the westwardyou would see the sun mirrored in the sea
of a very great size because as you are nearer to the sun your
eye taking in the rays nearer to the point of radiation takes more
of them in and a great splendour is the result and in this way it
can be proved that the moon must have seas which reflect the sun
and that the parts which do not shine are land

on the luminousity of the moon 892901
892
of the moon
as i propose to treat of the nature of the moon it is necessary
that first i should describe the perspective of mirrors whether
plane concave or convex and first what is meant by a luminous ray
and how it is refracted by various kinds of media then when a
reflected ray is most powerful whether when the angle of incidence
is acute right or obtuse or from a convex a plane or a concave
surface or from an opaque or a transparent body besides this how
it is that the solar rays which fall on the waves of the sea are
seen by the eye of the same width at the angle nearest to the eye
as at the highest line of the waves on the horizon but
notwithstanding this the solar rays reflected from the waves of the
sea assume the pyramidal form and consequently at each degree of
distance increase proportionally in size although to our sight
they appear as parallel
1st nothing that has very little weight is opaque
2dly nothing that is excessively weighty can remain beneath that
which is heavier
3dly as to whether the moon is situated in the centre of its
elements or not
and if it has no proper place of its own like the earth in the
midst of its elements why does it not fall to the centre of our
elements footnote 26 the problem here propounded by leonardo was
not satisfactorily answered till newton in 1682 formulated the law
of universal attraction and gravitation compare no 902 lines
515
and if the moon is not in the centre of its own elements and yet
does not fall it must then be lighter than any other element
and if the moon is lighter than the other elements why is it opaque
and not transparent
when objects of various sizes being placed at various distances
look of equal size there must be the same relative proportion in
the distances as in the magnitudes of the objects

of the moon and whether it is polished and spherical
the image of the sun in the moon is powerfully luminous and is only
on a small portion of its surface and the proof may be seen by
taking a ball of burnished gold and placing it in the dark with a
light at some distance from it and then although it will
illuminate about half of the ball the eye will perceive its
reflection only in a small part of its surface and all the rest of
the surface reflects the darkness which surrounds it so that it is
only in that spot that the image of the light is seen and all the
rest remains invisible the eye being at a distance from the ball
the same thing would happen on the surface of the moon if it were
polished lustrous and opaque like all bodies with a reflecting
surface
show how if you were standing on the moon or on a star our earth
would seem to reflect the sun as the moon does
and show that the image of the sun in the sea cannot appear one and
undivided as it appears in a perfectly plane mirror
894
how shadows are lost at great distances as is shown by the shadow
side of the moon which is never seen footnote compare also vol
i nos 175179
895
either the moon has intrinsic luminosity or not if it has why does
it not shine without the aid of the sun but if it has not any light
in itself it must of necessity be a spherical mirror and if it is a
mirror is it not proved in perspective that the image of a luminous
object will never be equal to the extent of surface of the
reflecting body that it illuminates and if it be thus footnote 13
at a in the diagram leonardo wrote sole the sun and at b
luna o noi terra the moon or our earth compare also the text
of no 876 as is here shown at r s in the figure whence comes
so great an extent of radiance as that of the full moon as we see
it at the fifteenth day of the moon
896
of the moon
the moon has no light in itself but so much of it as faces the sun
is illuminated and of that illumined portion we see so much as
faces the earth and the moons night receives just as much light as
is lent it by our waters as they reflect the image of the sun which
is mirrored in all those waters which are on the side towards the
sun the outside or surface of the waters forming the seas of the
moon and of the seas of our globe is always ruffled little or much
or more or lessand this roughness causes an extension of the
numberless images of the sun which are repeated in the ridges and
hollows the sides and fronts of the innumerable waves that is to
say in as many different spots on each wave as our eyes find
different positions to view them from this could not happen if the
aqueous sphere which covers a great part of the moon were uniformly
spherical for then the images of the sun would be one to each
spectator and its reflections would be separate and independent and
its radiance would always appear circular as is plainly to be seen
in the gilt balls placed on the tops of high buildings but if those
gilt balls were rugged or composed of several little balls like
mulberries which are a black fruit composed of minute round
globules then each portion of these little balls when seen in the
sun would display to the eye the lustre resulting from the
reflection of the sun and thus in one and the same body many tiny
suns would be seen and these often combine at a long distance and
appear as one the lustre of the new moon is brighter and stronger
than when the moon is full and the reason of this is that the angle
of incidence is more obtuse in the new than in the full moon in
which the angles of incidence and reflection are highly acute the
waves of the moon therefore mirror the sun in the hollows of the
waves as well as on the ridges and the sides remain in shadow but
at the sides of the moon the hollows of the waves do not catch the
sunlight but only their crests and thus the images are fewer and
more mixed up with the shadows in the hollows and this
intermingling of the shaded and illuminated spots comes to the eye
with a mitigated splendour so that the edges will be darker
because the curves of the sides of the waves are insufficient to
reflect to the eye the rays that fall upon them now the new moon
naturally reflects the solar rays more directly towards the eye from
the crests of the waves than from any other part as is shown by the
form of the moon whose rays a strike the waves b and are
reflected in the line b d the eye being situated at d this
cannot happen at the full moon when the solar rays being in the
west fall on the extreme waters of the moon to the east from n to
m and are not reflected to the eye in the west but are thrown
back eastwards with but slight deflection from the straight course
of the solar ray and thus the angle of incidence is very wide
indeed
the moon is an opaque and solid body and if on the contrary it
were transparent it would not receive the light of the sun
the yellow or yolk of an egg remains in the middle of the albumen
without moving on either side now it is either lighter or heavier
than this albumen or equal to it if it is lighter it ought to
rise above all the albumen and stop in contact with the shell of the
egg and if it is heavier it ought to sink and if it is equal it
might just as well be at one of the ends as in the middle or below
54
footnote 4864 compare no 861
the innumerable images of the solar rays reflected from the
innumerable waves of the sea as they fall upon those waves are
what cause us to see the very broad and continuous radiance on the
surface of the sea
897
that the sun could not be mirrored in the body of the moon which is
a convex mirror in such a way as that so much of its surface as is
illuminated by the sun should reflect the sun unless the moon had a
surface adapted to reflect itin waves and ridges like the surface
of the sea when its surface is moved by the wind
footnote in the original diagrams sole is written at the place
marked a luna at c and terra at the two spots marked b
the waves in water multiply the image of the object reflected in it
these waves reflect light each by its own line as the surface of
the fir cone does footnote 14 see the diagram p 145
these are 2 figures one different from the other one with
undulating water and the other with smooth water
it is impossible that at any distance the image of the sun cast on
the surface of a spherical body should occupy the half of the
sphere
here you must prove that the earth produces all the same effects
with regard to the moon as the moon with regard to the earth
the moon with its reflected light does not shine like the sun
because the light of the moon is not a continuous reflection of that
of the sun on its whole surface but only on the crests and hollows
of the waves of its waters and thus the sun being confusedly
reflected from the admixture of the shadows that lie between the
lustrous waves its light is not pure and clear as the sun is
footnote 38 this refers to the small diagram placed between b
and b the earth between the moon on the fifteenth day and the
sun footnote 39 see the diagram below the one referred to in the
preceding note here the sun is in the east and the moon on the
fifteenth day in the west footnote 4041 refers to the diagram
below the others the moon on the fifteenth day between the earth
and the sun 41here it is the moon which has the sun to the west
and the earth to the east
898
what sort of thing the moon is
the moon is not of itself luminous but is highly fitted to
assimilate the character of light after the manner of a mirror or
of water or of any other reflecting body and it grows larger in
the east and in the west like the sun and the other planets and
the reason is that every luminous body looks larger in proportion as
it is remote it is easy to understand that every planet and star is
farther from us when in the west than when it is overhead by about
3500 miles as is proved on the margin footnote 7 refers to the
first diagrama  sole the sun b  terra the earth c 
luna the moon and if you see the sun or moon mirrored in the
water near to you it looks to you of the same size in the water as
in the sky but if you recede to the distance of a mile it will
look 100 times larger and if you see the sun reflected in the sea
at sunset its image would look to you more than 10 miles long
because that reflected image extends over more than 10 miles of sea
and if you could stand where the moon is the sun would look to you
as if it were reflected from all the sea that it illuminates by day
and the land amid the water would appear just like the dark spots
that are on the moon which when looked at from our earth appears
to men the same as our earth would appear to any men who might dwell
in the moon

of the nature of the moon
when the moon is entirely lighted up to our sight we see its full
daylight and at that time owing to the reflection of the solar
rays which fall on it and are thrown off towards us its ocean casts
off less moisture towards us and the less light it gives the more
injurious it is

answer to maestro andrea da imola who said that the solar rays
reflected from a convex mirror are mingled and lost at a short
distance whereby it is altogether denied that the luminous side of
the moon is of the nature of a mirror and that consequently the
light is not produced by the innumerable multitude of the waves of
that sea which i declared to be the portion of the moon which is
illuminated by the solar rays

of the moon
no solid body is less heavy than the atmosphere
footnote 1 on the margin are the words tola romantina

kind of sheetiron no longer known by that name
having proved that the part of the moon that shines consists of
water which mirrors the body of the sun and reflects the radiance
it receives from it and that if these waters were devoid of waves
it would appear small but of a radiance almost like the sun 5
it must now be shown whether the moon is a heavy or a light body
for if it were a heavy bodyadmitting that at every grade of
distance from the earth greater levity must prevail so that water
is lighter than the earth and air than water and fire than air and
so on successivelyit would seem that if the moon had density as it
really has it would have weight and having weight that it could
not be sustained in the space where it is and consequently that it
would fall towards the centre of the universe and become united to
the earth or if not the moon itself at least its waters would fall
away and be lost from it and descend towards the centre leaving
the moon without any and so devoid of lustre but as this does not
happen as might in reason be expected it is a manifest sign that
the moon is surrounded by its own elements that is to say water
air and fire and thus is of itself and by itself suspended in
that part of space as our earth with its element is in this part of
space and that heavy bodies act in the midst of its elements just
as other heavy bodies do in ours footnote 15 this passage would
certainly seem to establish leonardos claim to be regarded as the
original discoverer of the cause of the ashy colour of the new moon

remained unknown to astronomers moestlin and kepler have been
credited with the discoveries which they made independently a
century later

when the eye is in the east and sees the moon in the west near to
the setting sun it sees it with its shaded portion surrounded by
luminous portions and the lateral and upper portion of this light
is derived from the sun and the lower portion from the ocean in the
west which receives the solar rays and reflects them on the lower
waters of the moon and indeed affords the part of the moon that is
in shadow as much radiance as the moon gives the earth at midnight
therefore it is not totally dark and hence some have believed that
the moon must in parts have a light of its own besides that which is
given it by the sun and this light is due as has been said to the
above mentioned causethat our seas are illuminated by the sun
again it might be said that the circle of radiance shown by the
moon when it and the sun are both in the west is wholly borrowed
from the sun when it and the sun and the eye are situated as is
shown above

stands between these two lines and the smaller one is sketched in
the margin at the spot marked a leonardo wrote corpo solare
solar body in the larger diagram and sole sun in the smaller
one at c luna moon is written and at b terra the earth
some might say that the air surrounding the moon as an element
catches the light of the sun as our atmosphere does and that it is
this which completes the luminous circle on the body of the moon
some have thought that the moon has a light of its own but this
opinion is false because they have founded it on that dim light
seen between the hornes of the new moon which looks dark where it
is close to the bright part while against the darkness of the
background it looks so light that many have taken it to be a ring of
new radiance completing the circle where the tips of the horns
illuminated by the sun cease to shine footnote 34 see pl cviii
no 5 and this difference of background arises from the fact that
the portion of that background which is conterminous with the bright
part of the moon by comparison with that brightness looks darker
than it is while at the upper part where a portion of the luminous
circle is to be seen of uniform width the result is that the moon
being brighter there than the medium or background on which it is
seen by comparison with that darkness it looks more luminous at that
edge than it is and that brightness at such a time itself is
derived from our ocean and other inlandseas these are at that
time illuminated by the sun which is already setting in such a way
as that the sea then fulfils the same function to the dark side of
the moon as the moon at its fifteenth day does to us when the sun is
set and the small amount of light which the dark side of the moon
receives bears the same proportion to the light of that side which
is illuminated as that footnote 42 here the text breaks off

on the spots in the moon 903907
903
the spots on the moon
some have said that vapours rise from the moon after the manner of
clouds and are interposed between the moon and our eyes but if
this were the case these spots would never be permanent either as
to position or form and seeing the moon from various aspects even
if these spots did not move they would change in form as objects do
which are seen from different sides
904
of the spots on the moon
others say that the moon is composed of more or less transparent
parts as though one part were something like alabaster and others
like crystal or glass it would follow from this that the sun
casting its rays on the less transparent portions the light would
remain on the surface and so the denser part would be illuminated
and the transparent portions would display the shadow of their
darker depths and this is their account of the structure and nature
of the moon and this opinion has found favour with many
philosophers and particularly with aristotle and yet it is a false
viewfor in the various phases and frequent changes of the moon
and sun to our eyes we should see these spots vary at one time
looking dark and at another light they would be dark when the sun
is in the west and the moon in the middle of the sky for then the
transparent hollows would be in shadow as far as the tops of the
edges of those transparent hollows because the sun could not then
fling his rays into the mouth of the hollows which however at full
moon would be seen in bright light at which time the moon is in
the east and faces the sun in the west then the sun would
illuminate even the lowest depths of these transparent places and
thus as there would be no shadows cast the moon at these times
would not show us the spots in question and so it would be now
more and now less according to the changes in the position of the
sun to the moon and of the moon to our eyes as i have said above
905
of the spots on the moon
it has been asserted that the spots on the moon result from the
moon being of varying thinness or density but if this were so when
there is an eclipse of the moon the solar rays would pierce through
the portions which were thin as is alleged footnote 35 eclissi
this word as it seems to me here means eclipses of the sun and
the sense of the passage as i understand it is that by the
foregoing hypothesis the moon when it comes between the sun and the
earth must appear as if piercedwe may say like a sieve but as
we do not see this effect the opinion must be false
others say that the surface of the moon is smooth and polished and
that like a mirror it reflects in itself the image of our earth
this view is also false inasmuch as the land where it is not
covered with water presents various aspects and forms hence when
the moon is in the east it would reflect different spots from those
it would show when it is above us or in the west now the spots on
the moon as they are seen at full moon never vary in the course of
its motion over our hemisphere a second reason is that an object
reflected in a convex body takes up but a small portion of that
body as is proved in perspective footnote 18 come e provato
this alludes to the accompanying diagram the third reason is that
when the moon is full it only faces half the hemisphere of the
illuminated earth on which only the ocean and other waters reflect
bright light while the land makes spots on that brightness thus
half of our earth would be seen girt round with the brightness of
the sea lighted up by the sun and in the moon this reflection would
be the smallest part of that moon fourthly a radiant body cannot
be reflected from another equally radiant therefore the sea since
it borrows its brightness from the sunas the moon does could
not cause the earth to be reflected in it nor indeed could the body
of the sun be seen reflected in it nor indeed any star opposite to
it
906
if you keep the details of the spots of the moon under observation
you will often find great variation in them and this i myself have
proved by drawing them and this is caused by the clouds that rise
from the waters in the moon which come between the sun and those
waters and by their shadow deprive these waters of the suns rays
thus those waters remain dark not being able to reflect the solar
body
907
how the spots on the moon must have varied from what they formerly
were by reason of the course of its waters
on the moons halo
908
of halos round the moon
i have found that the circles which at night seem to surround the
moon of various sizes and degrees of density are caused by various
gradations in the densities of the vapours which exist at different
altitudes between the moon and our eyes and of these halos the
largest and least red is caused by the lowest of these vapours the
second smaller one is higher up and looks redder because it is
seen through two vapours and so on as they are higher they will
appear smaller and redder because between the eye and them there
is thicker vapour whence it is proved that where they are seen to
be reddest the vapours are most dense
on instruments for observing the moon 909 910
909
if you want to prove why the moon appears larger than it is when it
reaches the horizon take a lens which is highly convex on one
surface and concave on the opposite and place the concave side next
the eye and look at the object beyond the convex surface by this
means you will have produced an exact imitation of the atmosphere
included beneath the sphere of fire and outside that of water for
this atmosphere is concave on the side next the earth and convex
towards the fire

when the sun is seen through the boughs of trees bare of their
leaves at some distance the branches do not conceal any portion of
the sun from our eye the same thing happens with the above
mentioned planets which though they have no light of their own do
notas has been saidconceal any part of the sun from our eye
18
second argument
some say that the stars appear most brilliant at night in proportion
as they are higher up and that if they had no light of their own
the shadow of the earth which comes between them and the sun would
darken them since they would not face nor be faced by the solar
body but those persons have not considered that the conical shadow
of the earth cannot reach many of the stars and even as to those it
does reach the cone is so much diminished that it covers very
little of the stars mass and all the rest is illuminated by the
sun
913
why the planets appear larger in the east than they do overhead
whereas the contrary should be the case as they are 3500 miles
nearer to us when in mid sky than when on the horizon
all the degrees of the elements through which the images of the
celestial bodies pass to reach the eye are equal curves and the
angles by which the central line of those images passes through
them are unequal angles footnote 13 inequali here and
elsewhere does not mean unequal in the sense of not being equal to
each other but angles which are not right angles and the
distance is greater as is shown by the excess of a b beyond a
d and the enlargement of these celestial bodies on the horizon is
shown by the 9th of the 7th

of time and its divisions 916918
916
although time is included in the class of continuous quantities
being indivisible and immaterial it does not come entirely under
the head of geometry which represents its divisions by means of
figures and bodies of infinite variety such as are seen to be
continuous in their visible and material properties but only with
its first principles does it agree that is with the point and the
line the point may be compared to an instant of time and the line
may be likened to the length of a certain quantity of time and just
as a line begins and terminates in a point so such a space of time
begins and terminates in an instant and whereas a line is
infinitely divisible the divisibility of a space of time is of the
same nature and as the divisions of the line may bear a certain
proportion to each other so may the divisions of time

physical geography
leonardos researches as to the structure of the earth and sea were
made at a time when the extended voyages of the spaniards and
portuguese had also excited a special interest in geographical
questions in italy and particularly in tuscany still it need
scarcely surprise us to find that in deeper questions as to the
structure of the globe the primitive state of the earths surface
and the like he was far in advance of his time
the number of passages which treat of such matters is relatively
considerable like almost all leonardos scientific notes they deal
partly with theoretical and partly with practical questions some of
his theoretical views of the motion of water were collected in a
copied manuscript volume by an early transcriber but without any
acknowledgment of the source whence they were derived this copy is
now in the library of the barberini palace at rome and was published
under the title de moto e misura dellacqua by francesco
cardinali bologna 1828 in this work the texts are arranged under
the following titles libr i della spera dellacqua libr ii
del moto dellacqua libr iii dellonda dellacqua libr iv dei
retrosi dacqua libr v dellacqua cadente libr vi delle
rotture fatte dallacqua libr vii delle cose portate dallacqua
libr viii delloncia dellacqua e delle canne libr ix de molini

the large number of isolated observations scattered through the
manuscripts accounts for our so frequently finding notes of new
schemes for the arrangement of those relating to water and its
motions particularly in the codex atlanticus i have printed
several of these plans as an introduction to the physical geography
and i have actually arranged the texts in accordance with the clue
afforded by one of them which is undoubtedly one of the latest notes
referring to the subject no 920 the text given as no 930
which is also taken from a late notebook of leonardos served as
a basis for the arrangement of the first of the seven booksor
sections bearing the title of the nature of water dellacque
in se
as i have not made it any part of this undertaking to print the
passages which refer to purely physical principles it has also been
necessary to exclude those practical researches which in accordance
with indications given in 920 ought to come in as books 13 14
and 15 i can only incidentally mention here that leonardoas it
seems to me especially in his youthdevoted a great deal of
attention to the construction of mills this is proved by a number
of drawings of very careful and minute execution which are to be
found in the codex atlanticus nor was it possible to include his
considerations on the regulation of rivers the making of canals and
so forth no 920 books 10 11 and 12 but those passages in
which the structure of a canal is directly connected with notices of
particular places will be found duly inserted under section xvii
topographical notes in vol i no 5 the text refers to
canalmaking in general
on one point only can the collection of passages included under the
general heading of physical geography claim to be complete when
comparing and sorting the materials for this work i took particular
care not to exclude or omit any text in which a geographical name
was mentioned even incidentally since in all such researches the
chief interest as it appeared to me attached to the question
whether these acute observations on the various local
characteristics of mountains rivers or seas had been made by
leonardo himself and on the spot it is selfevident that the few
general and somewhat superficial observations on the rhine and the
danube on england and flanders must have been obtained from maps
or from some informants and in the case of flanders leonardo
himself acknowledges this see no 1008 but that most of the
other and more exact observations were made on the spot by
leonardo himself may be safely assumed from their method and the
style in which he writes of them and we should bear it in mind that
in all investigations of whatever kind experience is always spoken
of as the only basis on which he relies incidentally as in no
984 he thinks it necessary to allude to the total absence of all
recorded observations

general introduction
929
the beginning of the treatise on water
by the ancients man has been called the world in miniature and
certainly this name is well bestowed because inasmuch as man is
composed of earth water air and fire his body resembles that of
the earth and as man has in him bones the supports and framework of
his flesh the world has its rocks the supports of the earth as man
has in him a pool of blood in which the lungs rise and fall in
breathing so the body of the earth has its ocean tide which
likewise rises and falls every six hours as if the world breathed
as in that pool of blood veins have their origin which ramify all
over the human body so likewise the ocean sea fills the body of the
earth with infinite springs of water the body of the earth lacks
sinews and this is because the sinews are made expressely for
movements and the world being perpetually stable no movement takes
place and no movement taking place muscles are not necessary
but in all other points they are much alike

of the nature of water
the arrangement of book i
930
the order of the first book on water
define first what is meant by height and depth also how the
elements are situated one inside another then what is meant by
solid weight and by liquid weight but first what weight and
lightness are in themselves then describe why water moves and why
its motion ceases then why it becomes slower or more rapid besides
this how it always falls being in contact with the air but lower
than the air and how water rises in the air by means of the heat of
the sun and then falls again in rain again why water springs
forth from the tops of mountains and if the water of any spring
higher than the ocean can pour forth water higher than the surface
of that ocean and how all the water that returns to the ocean is
higher than the sphere of waters and how the waters of the
equatorial seas are higher than the waters of the north and higher
beneath the body of the sun than in any part of the equatorial
circle for experiment shows that under the heat of a burning brand
the water near the brand boils and the water surrounding this
ebullition always sinks with a circular eddy and how the waters of
the north are lower than the other seas and more so as they become
colder until they are converted into ice
definitions 931 932
931
of what is water
among the four elements water is the second both in weight and in
instability
932
the beginning of the book on water
sea is the name given to that water which is wide and deep in which
the waters have not much motion
footnote only the beginning of this passage is here given the
remainder consists of definitions which have no direct bearing on
the subject
of the surface of the water in relation to the globe 933936
933
the centres of the sphere of water are two one universal and common
to all water the other particular the universal one is that which
is common to all waters not in motion which exist in great
quantities as canals ditches ponds fountains wells dead
rivers lakes stagnant pools and seas which although they are at
various levels have each in itself the limits of their superficies
equally distant from the centre of the earth such as lakes placed
at the tops of high mountains as the lake near pietra pana and the
lake of the sybil near norcia and all the lakes that give rise to
great rivers as the ticino from lago maggiore the adda from the
lake of como the mincio from the lake of garda the rhine from the
lakes of constance and of chur and from the lake of lucerne like
the tigris which passes through asia minor carrying with it the
waters of three lakes one above the other at different heights of
which the highest is munace the middle one pallas and the lowest
triton the nile again flows from three very high lakes in ethiopia
footnote 5 pietra pana a mountain near florence if for norcia
we may read norchia the remains of the etruscan city near viterbo
there can be no doubt that by lago della sibillaa name not
known elsewhere so far as i can learnleonardo meant lago di
vico lacus ciminus aen 7
934
of the centre of the ocean
the centre of the sphere of waters is the true centre of the globe
of our world which is composed of water and earth having the shape
of a sphere but if you want to find the centre of the element of
the earth this is placed at a point equidistant from the surface of
the ocean and not equidistant from the surface of the earth for it
is evident that this globe of earth has nowhere any perfect
rotundity excepting in places where the sea is or marshes or other
still waters and every part of the earth that rises above the water
is farther from the centre
935
of the sea which changes the weight of the earth
the shells oysters and other similar animals which originate in
seamud bear witness to the changes of the earth round the centre
of our elements this is proved thus great rivers always run
turbid being coloured by the earth which is stirred by the
friction of their waters at the bottom and on their shores and this
wearing disturbs the face of the strata made by the layers of
shells which lie on the surface of the marine mud and which were
produced there when the salt waters covered them and these strata
were covered over again from time to time with mud of various
thickness or carried down to the sea by the rivers and floods of
more or less extent and thus these layers of mud became raised to
such a height that they came up from the bottom to the air at the
present time these bottoms are so high that they form hills or high
mountains and the rivers which wear away the sides of these
mountains uncover the strata of these shells and thus the softened
side of the earth continually rises and the antipodes sink closer to
the centre of the earth and the ancient bottoms of the seas have
become mountain ridges
936
let the earth make whatever changes it may in its weight the
surface of the sphere of waters can never vary in its equal distance
from the centre of the world
of the proportion of the mass of water to that of the earth 937
938
937
whether the earth is less than the water
some assert that it is true that the earth which is not covered by
water is much less than that covered by water but considering the
size of 7000 miles in diameter which is that of this earth we may
conclude the water to be of small depth
938
of the earth
the great elevations of the peaks of the mountains above the sphere
of the water may have resulted from this that a very large portion
of the earth which was filled with water that is to say the vast
cavern inside the earth may have fallen in a vast part of its vault
towards the centre of the earth being pierced by means of the
course of the springs which continually wear away the place where
they pass
sinking in of countries like the dead sea in syria that is sodom
and gomorrah
it is of necessity that there should be more water than land and
the visible portion of the sea does not show this so that there
must be a great deal of water inside the earth besides that which
rises into the lower air and which flows through rivers and springs
footnote the small sketch below on the left is placed in the
original close to the text referring to the dead sea
the theory of plato
939
the figures of the elements
of the figures of the elements and first as against those who deny
the opinions of plato and who say that if the elements include one
another in the forms attributed to them by plato they would cause a
vacuum one within the other i say it is not true and i here prove
it but first i desire to propound some conclusions it is not
necessary that the elements which include each other should be of
corresponding magnitude in all the parts of that which includes and
of that which is included we see that the sphere of the waters
varies conspicuously in mass from the surface to the bottom and
that far from investing the earth when that was in the form of a
cube that is of 8 angles as plato will have it that it invests the
earth which has innumerable angles of rock covered by the water and
various prominences and concavities and yet no vacuum is generated
between the earth and water again the air invests the sphere of
waters together with the mountains and valleys which rise above
that sphere and no vacuum remains between the earth and the air so
that any one who says a vacuum is generated speaks foolishly
but to plato i would reply that the surface of the figures which
according to him the elements would have could not exist
that the flow of rivers proves the slope of the land
940
proves how the earth is not globular and not being globular cannot
have a common centre
we see the nile come from southern regions and traverse various
provinces running towards the north for a distance of 3000 miles
and flow into the mediterranean by the shores of egypt and if we
will give to this a fall of ten braccia a mile as is usually
allowed to the course of rivers in general we shall find that the
nile must have its mouth ten miles lower than its source again we
see the rhine the rhone and the danube starting from the german
parts almost the centre of europe and having a course one to the
east the other to the north and the last to southern seas and if
you consider all this you will see that the plains of europe in
their aggregate are much higher than the high peaks of the maritime
mountains think then how much their tops must be above the sea
shores
theory of the elevation of water within the mountains
941
of the heat that is in the world
where there is life there is heat and where vital heat is there is
movement of vapour this is proved inasmuch as we see that the
element of fire by its heat always draws to itself damp vapours and
thick mists as opaque clouds which it raises from seas as well as
lakes and rivers and damp valleys and these being drawn by degrees
as far as the cold region the first portion stops because heat and
moisture cannot exist with cold and dryness and where the first
portion stops the rest settle and thus one portion after another
being added thick and dark clouds are formed they are often wafted
about and borne by the winds from one region to another where by
their density they become so heavy that they fall in thick rain and
if the heat of the sun is added to the power of the element of fire
the clouds are drawn up higher still and find a greater degree of
cold in which they form ice and fall in storms of hail now the
same heat which holds up so great a weight of water as is seen to
rain from the clouds draws them from below upwards from the foot
of the mountains and leads and holds them within the summits of the
mountains and these finding some fissure issue continuously and
cause rivers
the relative height of the surface of the sea to that of the land
942945
942
of the sea which to many fools appears to be higher than the earth
which forms its shore
b d is a plain through which a river flows to the sea this plain
ends at the sea and since in fact the dry land that is uncovered is
not perfectly levelfor if it were the river would have no
motionas the river does move this place is a slope rather than a
plain hence this plain d b so ends where the sphere of water
begins that if it were extended in a continuous line to b a it
would go down beneath the sea whence it follows that the sea a c
b looks higher than the dry land
obviously no portions of dry land left uncovered by water can ever
be lower than the surface of the watery sphere
943
of certain persons who say the waters were higher than the dry land
certainly i wonder not a little at the common opinion which is
contrary to truth but held by the universal consent of the judgment
of men and this is that all are agreed that the surface of the sea
is higher than the highest peaks of the mountains and they allege
many vain and childish reasons against which i will allege only one
simple and short reason we see plainly that if we could remove the
shores of the sea it would invest the whole earth and make it a
perfect sphere now consider how much earth would be carried away
to enable the waves of the sea to cover the world therefore that
which would be carried away must be higher than the seashore
944
the opinion of some persons who say that the water of some seas is
higher than the highest summits of mountains and nevertheless the
water was forced up to these summits
water would not move from place to place if it were not that it
seeks the lowest level and by a natural consequence it never can
return to a height like that of the place where it first on issuing
from the mountain came to light and that portion of the sea which
in your vain imagining you say was so high that it flowed over the
summits of the high mountains for so many centuries would be
swallowed up and poured out again through the issue from these
mountains you can well imagine that all the time that tigris and
euphrates
945
have flowed from the summits of the mountains of armenia it must be
believed that all the water of the ocean has passed very many times
through these mouths and do you not believe that the nile must have
sent more water into the sea than at present exists of all the
element of water undoubtedly yes and if all this water had fallen
away from this body of the earth this terrestrial machine would
long since have been without water whence we may conclude that the
water goes from the rivers to the sea and from the sea to the
rivers thus constantly circulating and returning and that all the
sea and the rivers have passed through the mouth of the nile an
infinite number of times footnote moti armeni ermini in the

refutation of plinys theory as to the saltness of the sea 946
947
946
why water is salt
pliny says in his second book chapter 103 that the water of the
sea is salt because the heat of the sun dries up the moisture and
drinks it up and this gives to the wide stretching sea the savour
of salt but this cannot be admitted because if the saltness of the
sea were caused by the heat of the sun there can be no doubt that
lakes pools and marshes would be so much the more salt as their
waters have less motion and are of less depth but experience shows
us on the contrary that these lakes have their waters quite free
from salt again it is stated by pliny in the same chapter that this
saltness might originate because all the sweet and subtle portions
which the heat attracts easily being taken away the more bitter and
coarser part will remain and thus the water on the surface is
fresher than at the bottom footnote 22 compare no 948 but this
is contradicted by the same reason given above which is that the
same thing would happen in marshes and other waters which are dried
up by the heat again it has been said that the saltness of the sea
is the sweat of the earth to this it may be answered that all the
springs of water which penetrate through the earth would then be
salt but the conclusion is that the saltness of the sea must
proceed from the many springs of water which as they penetrate into
the earth find mines of salt and these they dissolve in part and
carry with them to the ocean and the other seas whence the clouds
the begetters of rivers never carry it up and the sea would be
salter in our times than ever it was at any time and if the
adversary were to say that in infinite time the sea would dry up or
congeal into salt to this i answer that this salt is restored to
the earth by the setting free of that part of the earth which rises
out of the sea with the salt it has acquired and the rivers return
it to the earth under the sea

947
for the third and last reason we will say that salt is in all
created things and this we learn from water passed over the ashes
and cinders of burnt things and the urine of every animal and the
superfluities issuing from their bodies and the earth into which
all things are converted by corruption
butto put it bettergiven that the world is everlasting it
must be admitted that its population will also be eternal hence the
human species has eternally been and would be consumers of salt and
if all the mass of the earth were to be turned into salt it would
not suffice for all human food footnote 27 that is on the
supposition that salt once consumed disappears for ever whence
we are forced to admit either that the species of salt must be
everlasting like the world or that it dies and is born again like
the men who devour it but as experience teaches us that it does not
die as is evident by fire which does not consume it and by water
which becomes salt in proportion to the quantity dissolved in
itand when it is evaporated the salt always remains in the
original quantityit must pass through the bodies of men either in
the urine or the sweat or other excretions where it is found again
and as much salt is thus got rid of as is carried every year into
towns therefore salt is dug in places where there is urine sea
hogs and sea winds are salt
we will say that the rains which penetrate the earth are what is
under the foundations of cities with their inhabitants and are what
restore through the internal passages of the earth the saltness
taken from the sea and that the change in the place of the sea
which has been over all the mountains caused it to be left there in
the mines found in those mountains c
the characteristics of sea water 948 949
948
the waters of the salt sea are fresh at the greatest depths
949
that the ocean does not penetrate under the earth
the ocean does not penetrate under the earth and this we learn from
the many and various springs of fresh water which in many parts of
the ocean make their way up from the bottom to the surface the same
thing is farther proved by wells dug beyond the distance of a mile
from the said ocean which fill with fresh water and this happens
because the fresh water is lighter than salt water and consequently
more penetrating
which weighs most water when frozen or when not frozen
fresh water penetrates more against salt water than salt water
against fresh water
that fresh water penetrates more against salt water than salt water
against fresh is proved by a thin cloth dry and old hanging with
the two opposite ends equally low in the two different waters the
surfaces of which are at an equal level and it will then be seen
how much higher the fresh water will rise in this piece of linen
than the salt by so much is the fresh lighter than the salt
on the formation of gulfs 950 951
950
all inland seas and the gulfs of those seas are made by rivers
which flow into the sea
951
here the reason is given of the effects produced by the waters in
the above mentioned place
all the lakes and all the gulfs of the sea and all inland seas are
due to rivers which distribute their waters into them and from
impediments in their downfall into the mediterranean which divides
africa from europe and europe from asia by means of the nile and the
don which pour their waters into it it is asked what impediment is
great enough to stop the course of the waters which do not reach the
ocean
on the encroachments of the sea on the land and vice versa
952954
952
of waves
a wave of the sea always breaks in front of its base and that
portion of the crest will then be lowest which before was highest
footnote the page of francesco di giorgios trattato on which
leonardo has written this remark contains some notes on the
construction of dams harbours c
953
that the shores of the sea constantly acquire more soil towards the
middle of the sea that the rocks and promontories of the sea are
constantly being ruined and worn away that the mediterranean seas
will in time discover their bottom to the air and all that will be
left will be the channel of the greatest river that enters it and
this will run to the ocean and pour its waters into that with those
of all the rivers that are its tributaries
954
how the river po in a short time might dry up the adriatic sea in
the same way as it has dried up a large part of lombardy
the ebb and flow of the tide 955960
955
where there is a larger quantity of water there is a greater flow
and ebb but the contrary in narrow waters
look whether the sea is at its greatest flow when the moon is half
way over our hemisphere on the meridian
956
whether the flow and ebb are caused by the moon or the sun or are
the breathing of this terrestrial machine that the flow and ebb are
different in different countries and seas
footnote 1 allusion may here be made to the mythological
explanation of the ebb and flow given in the edda utgardloki says
to thor gylfaginning 48 when thou wert drinking out of the horn
and it seemed to thee that it was slow in emptying a wonder befell
which i should not have believed possible the other end of the horn
lay in the sea which thou sawest not but when thou shalt go to the
sea thou shalt see how much thou hast drunk out of it and that men
now call the ebb tide
several passages in various manuscripts treat of the ebb and flow
in collecting them i have been guided by the rule only to transcribe
those which named some particular spot
957
book 9 of the meeting of rivers and their flow and ebb the cause is
the same in the sea where it is caused by the straits of gibraltar
and again it is caused by whirlpools
958
of the flow and ebb
all seas have their flow and ebb in the same period but they seem
to vary because the days do not begin at the same time throughout
the universe in such wise as that when it is midday in our
hemisphere it is midnight in the opposite hemisphere and at the
eastern boundary of the two hemispheres the night begins which
follows on the day and at the western boundary of these hemispheres
begins the day which follows the night from the opposite side
hence it is to be inferred that the above mentioned swelling and
diminution in the height of the seas although they take place in
one and the same space of time are seen to vary from the above
mentioned causes the waters are then withdrawn into the fissures
which start from the depths of the sea and which ramify inside the
body of the earth corresponding to the sources of rivers which are
constantly taking from the bottom of the sea the water which has
flowed into it a sea of water is incessantly being drawn off from
the surface of the sea and if you should think that the moon
rising at the eastern end of the mediterranean sea must there begin
to attract to herself the waters of the sea it would follow that we
must at once see the effect of it at the eastern end of that sea
again as the mediterranean sea is about the eighth part of the
circumference of the aqueous sphere being 3000 miles long while
the flow and ebb only occur 4 times in 24 hours these results would
not agree with the time of 24 hours unless this mediterranean sea
were six thousand miles in length because if such a superabundance
of water had to pass through the straits of gibraltar in running
behind the moon the rush of the water through that strait would be
so great and would rise to such a height that beyond the straits
it would for many miles rush so violently into the ocean as to cause
floods and tremendous seething so that it would be impossible to
pass through this agitated ocean would afterwards return the waters
it had received with equal fury to the place they had come from so
that no one ever could pass through those straits now experience
shows that at every hour they are passed in safety but when the
wind sets in the same direction as the current the strong ebb
increases footnote 23 in attempting to get out of the
mediterranean vessels are sometimes detained for a considerable
time not merely by the causes mentioned by leonardo but by the
constant current flowing eastwards through the middle of the straits
of gibraltar the sea does not raise the water that has issued
from the straits but it checks them and this retards the tide then
it makes up with furious haste for the time it has lost until the
end of the ebb movement
959
that the flow and ebb are not general for on the shore at genoa
there is none at venice two braccia between england and flanders
18 braccia that in the straits of sicily the current is very strong
because all the waters from the rivers that flow into the adriatic
pass there
footnote a few more recent data may be given here to facilitate
comparison in the adriatic the tide rises 2 and 12 feet at
terracina 1 14 in the english channel between calais and kent it
rises from 18 to 20 feet in the straits of messina it rises no more
than 2 12 feet and that only in stormy weather but the current is
all the stronger when leonardo accounts for this by the southward
flow of all the italian rivers along the coasts the explanation is
at least based on a correct observation namely that a steady
current flows southwards along the coast of calabria and another
northwards along the shores of sicily he seems to infer from the
direction of the fust that the tide in the adriatic is caused by
it
960
in the west near to flanders the sea rises and decreases every 6
hours about 20 braccia and 22 when the moon is in its favour but
20 braccia is the general rule and this rule as it is evident
cannot have the moon for its cause this variation in the increase
and decrease of the sea every 6 hours may arise from the damming up
of the waters which are poured into the mediterranean by the
quantity of rivers from africa asia and europe which flow into
that sea and the waters which are given to it by those rivers it
pours them to the ocean through the straits of gibraltar between
abila and calpe footnote 5 abila lat abyla gr  now
sierra ximiera near ceuta calpe lat calpe gr now
gibraltar leonardo here uses the ancient names of the rocks which
were known as the pillars of hercules that ocean extends to the
island of england and others farther north and it becomes dammed up
and kept high in various gulfs these being seas of which the
surface is remote from the centre of the earth have acquired a
weight which as it is greater than the force of the incoming waters
which cause it gives this water an impetus in the contrary
direction to that in which it came and it is borne back to meet the
waters coming out of the straits and this it does most against the
straits of gibraltar these so long as this goes on remain dammed
up and all the water which is poured out meanwhile by the
aforementioned rivers is pent up in the mediterranean and this
might be assigned as the cause of its flow and ebb as is shown in
the 21st of the 4th of my theory
iii
subterranean water courses
theory of the circulation of the waters 961 962
961
very large rivers flow under ground
962
this is meant to represent the earth cut through in the middle
showing the depths of the sea and of the earth the waters start
from the bottom of the seas and ramifying through the earth they
rise to the summits of the mountains flowing back by the rivers and
returning to the sea
observations in support of the hypothesis 963969
963
the waters circulate with constant motion from the utmost depths of
the sea to the highest summits of the mountains not obeying the
nature of heavy matter and in this case it acts as does the blood
of animals which is always moving from the sea of the heart and
flows to the top of their heads and here it is that veins burstas
one may see when a vein bursts in the nose that all the blood from
below rises to the level of the burst vein when the water rushes
out of a burst vein in the earth it obeys the nature of other things
heavier than the air whence it always seeks the lowest places 7
these waters traverse the body of the earth with infinite
ramifications
footnote the greater part of this passage has been given as no
849 in the section on anatomy
964
the same cause which stirs the humours in every species of animal
body and by which every injury is repaired also moves the waters
from the utmost depth of the sea to the greatest heights
965
it is the property of water that it constitutes the vital human of
this arid earth and the cause which moves it through its ramified
veins against the natural course of heavy matters is the same
property which moves the humours in every species of animal body
but that which crowns our wonder in contemplating it is that it
rises from the utmost depths of the sea to the highest tops of the
mountains and flowing from the opened veins returns to the low
seas then once more and with extreme swiftness it mounts again
and returns by the same descent thus rising from the inside to the
outside and going round from the lowest to the highest from whence
it rushes down in a natural course thus by these two movements
combined in a constant circulation it travels through the veins of
the earth
966
whether water rises from the sea to the tops of mountains
the water of the ocean cannot make its way from the bases to the
tops of the mountains which bound it but only so much rises as the
dryness of the mountain attracts and if on the contrary the rain
which penetrates from the summit of the mountain to the base which
is the boundary of the sea descends and softens the slope opposite
to the said mountain and constantly draws the water like a syphon
footnote 11 cicognola syphon see vol i pl xxiv no 1 which
pours through its longest side it must be this which draws up the
water of the sea thus if s n were the surface of the sea and the
rain descends from the top of the mountain a to n on one side
and on the other sides it descends from a to m without a doubt
this would occur after the manner of distilling through felt or as
happens through the tubes called syphons footnote 17 cicognola
syphon see vol i pl xxiv no 1 and at all times the water
which has softened the mountain by the great rain which runs down
the two opposite sides would constantly attract the rain a n on
its longest side together with the water from the sea if that side
of the mountain a m were longer than the other a n but this
cannot be because no part of the earth which is not submerged by
the ocean can be lower than that ocean
967
of springs of water on the tops of mountains
it is quite evident that the whole surface of the oceanwhen there
is no stormis at an equal distance from the centre of the earth
and that the tops of the mountains are farther from this centre in
proportion as they rise above the surface of that sea therefore if
the body of the earth were not like that of man it would be
impossible that the waters of the seabeing so much lower than the
mountainscould by their nature rise up to the summits of these
mountains hence it is to be believed that the same cause which
keeps the blood at the top of the head in man keeps the water at the
summits of the mountains
footnote this conception of the rising of the blood which has
given rise to the comparison was recognised as erroneous by
leonardo himself at a later period it must be remembered that the
ms a from which these passages are taken was written about twenty
years earlier than the ms leic nos 963 and 849 and twentyfive
years before the ms w an iv
there is in the original a sketch with no 968 which is not
reproduced it represents a hill of the same shape as that shown at
no 982 there are veins or branched streams on the side of the
hill like those on the skull pl cviii no 4
968
in confirmation of why the water goes to the tops of mountains
i say that just as the natural heat of the blood in the veins keeps
it in the head of manfor when the man is dead the cold blood
sinks to the lower partsand when the sun is hot on the head of a
man the blood increases and rises so much with other humours that
by pressure in the veins pains in the head are often caused in the
same way veins ramify through the body of the earth and by the
natural heat which is distributed throughout the containing body
the water is raised through the veins to the tops of mountains and
this water which passes through a closed conduit inside the body of
the mountain like a dead thing cannot come forth from its low place
unless it is warmed by the vital heat of the spring time again the
heat of the element of fire and by day the heat of the sun have
power to draw forth the moisture of the low parts of the mountains
and to draw them up in the same way as it draws the clouds and
collects their moisture from the bed of the sea
969
that many springs of salt water are found at great distances from
the sea this might happen because such springs pass through some
mine of salt like that in hungary where salt is hewn out of vast
caverns just as stone is hewn
footnote the great mine of wieliczka in galicia out of which a
million cwt of rocksalt are annually dug out extends for 3000
metres from west to east and 1150 metres from north to south
iv
of rivers
on the way in which the sources of rivers are fed
970
of the origin of rivers
the body of the earth like the bodies of animals is intersected
with ramifications of waters which are all in connection and are
constituted to give nutriment and life to the earth and to its
creatures these come from the depth of the sea and after many
revolutions have to return to it by the rivers created by the
bursting of these springs and if you chose to say that the rains of
the winter or the melting of the snows in summer were the cause of
the birth of rivers i could mention the rivers which originate in
the torrid countries of africa where it never rainsand still less
snowsbecause the intense heat always melts into air all the clouds
which are borne thither by the winds and if you chose to say that
such rivers as increase in july and august come from the snows
which melt in may and june from the suns approach to the snows on
the mountains of scythia footnote 9 scythia means here as in
ancient geography the whole of the northern part of asia as far as
india and that such meltings come down into certain valleys and
form lakes into which they enter by springs and subterranean caves
to issue forth again at the sources of the nile this is false
because scythia is lower than the sources of the nile and besides
scythia is only 400 miles from the black sea and the sources of the
nile are 3000 miles distant from the sea of egypt into which its
waters flow

book 9 of the meeting of rivers and of their ebb and flow the
cause is the same in the sea where it is caused by the straits of
gibraltar and again it is caused by whirlpools
3 if two rivers meet together to form a straight line and then
below two right angles take their course together the flow and ebb
will happen now in one river and now in the other above their
confluence and principally if the outlet for their united volume is
no swifter than when they were separate here occur 4 instances
footnote the first two lines of this passage have already been
given as no 957 in the margin near line 3 of this passage the
text given as no 919 is written
on the alterations caused in the courses of rivers by their
confluence 972974
972
when a smaller river pours its waters into a larger one and that
larger one flows from the opposite direction the course of the
smaller river will bend up against the approach of the larger river
and this happens because when the larger river fills up all its bed
with water it makes an eddy in front of the mouth of the other
river and so carries the water poured in by the smaller river with
its own when the smaller river pours its waters into the larger
one which runs across the current at the mouth of the smaller
river its waters will bend with the downward movement of the larger
river footnote in the original sketches the word arno is
written at the spot here marked a at r rifredi and at m
mugnone
973
when the fulness of rivers is diminished then the acute angles
formed at the junction of their branches become shorter at the sides
and wider at the point like the current a n and the current d
n which unite in n when the river is at its greatest fulness i
say that when it is in this condition if before the fullest time
d n was lower than a n at the time of fulness d n will be
full of sand and mud when the water d n falls it will carry away
the mud and remain with a lower bottom and the channel a n
finding itself the higher will fling its waters into the lower d
n and will wash away all the point of the sandspit b n c and
thus the angle a c d will remain larger than the angle a n d and
the sides shorter as i said before

of the movement of a sudden rush made by a river in its bed
previously dry
in proportion as the current of the water given forth by the
draining of the lake is slow or rapid in the dry river bed so will
this river be wider or narrower or shallower or deeper in one place
than another according to this proposition the flow and ebb of the
sea which enters the mediterranean from the ocean and of the rivers
which meet and struggle with it will raise their waters more or
less in proportion as the sea is wider or narrower

of the vibration of the earth
the subterranean channels of waters like those which exist between
the air and the earth are those which unceasingly wear away and
deepen the beds of their currents
the origin of the sand in rivers 977 978
977
a river that flows from mountains deposits a great quantity of large
stones in its bed which still have some of their angles and sides
and in the course of its flow it carries down smaller stones with
the angles more worn that is to say the large stones become
smaller and farther on it deposits coarse gravel and then smaller
and as it proceeds this becomes coarse sand and then finer and
going on thus the water turbid with sand and gravel joins the sea
and the sand settles on the seashores being cast up by the salt
waves and there results the sand of so fine a nature as to seem
almost like water and it will not stop on the shores of the sea but
returns by reason of its lightness because it was originally formed
of rotten leaves and other very light things still being
almostas was saidof the nature of water itself it afterwards
when the weather is calm settles and becomes solid at the bottom of
the sea where by its fineness it becomes compact and by its
smoothness resists the waves which glide over it and in this shells
are found and this is white earth fit for pottery
978
all the torrents of water flowing from the mountains to the sea
carry with them the stones from the hills to the sea and by the
influx of the seawater towards the mountains these stones were
thrown back towards the mountains and as the waters rose and
retired the stones were tossed about by it and in rolling their
angles hit together then as the parts which least resisted the
blows were worn off the stones ceased to be angular and became
round in form as may be seen on the banks of the elsa and those
remained larger which were less removed from their native spot and
they became smaller the farther they were carried from that place
so that in the process they were converted into small pebbles and
then into sand and at last into mud after the sea had receded from
the mountains the brine left by the sea with other humours of the
earth made a concretion of these pebbles and this sand so that the
pebbles were converted into rock and the sand into tufa and of this
we see an example in the adda where it issues from the mountains of
como and in the ticino the adige and the oglio coming from the
german alps and in the arno at monte albano footnote 13 at the
foot of monte albano lies vinci the birth place of leonardo
opposite on the other bank of the arno is monte lupo near

that the northern bases of some alps are not yet petrified and this
is plainly to be seen where the rivers which cut through them flow
towards the north where they cut through the strata in the living
stone in the higher parts of the mountains and where they join the
plains these strata are all of potters clay as is to be seen in
the valley of lamona where the river lamona as it issues from the
appenines does these things on its banks
that the rivers have all cut and divided the mountains of the great
alps one from the other this is visible in the order of the
stratified rocks because from the summits of the banks down to the
river the correspondence of the strata in the rocks is visible on
either side of the river that the stratified stones of the
mountains are all layers of clay deposited one above the other by
the various floods of the rivers that the different size of the
strata is caused by the difference in the floodsthat is to say
greater or lesser floods
981
the summits of mountains for a long time rise constantly
the opposite sides of the mountains always approach each other
below the depths of the valleys which are above the sphere of the
waters are in the course of time constantly getting nearer to the
centre of the world
in an equal period the valleys sink much more than the mountains
rise
the bases of the mountains always come closer together
in proportion as the valleys become deeper the more quickly are
their sides worn away

find the divisions of the strata in the rocks

since things are much more ancient than letters it is no marvel if
in our day no records exist of these seas having covered so many
countries and if moreover some records had existed war and
conflagrations the deluge of waters the changes of languages and
of laws have consumed every thing ancient but sufficient for us is
the testimony of things created in the salt waters and found again
in high mountains far from the seas

geological problems
985
in this work you have first to prove that the shells at a thousand
braccia of elevation were not carried there by the deluge because
they are seen to be all at one level and many mountains are seen to
be above that level and to inquire whether the deluge was caused by
rain or by the swelling of the sea and then you must show how
neither by rain nor by swelling of the rivers nor by the overflow
of this sea could the shellsbeing heavy objectsbe floated up
the mountains by the sea nor have carried there by the rivers
against the course of their waters
doubts about the deluge
986
a doubtful point
here a doubt arises and that is whether the deluge which happened
at the time of noah was universal or not and it would seem not
for the reasons now to be given we have it in the bible that this
deluge lasted 40 days and 40 nights of incessant and universal rain
and that this rain rose to ten cubits above the highest mountains in
the world and if it had been that the rain was universal it would
have covered our globe which is spherical in form and this
spherical surface is equally distant in every part from the centre
of its sphere hence the sphere of the waters being under the same
conditions it is impossible that the water upon it should move
because water in itself does not move unless it falls therefore
how could the waters of such a deluge depart if it is proved that
it has no motion and if it departed how could it move unless it
went upwards here then natural reasons are wanting hence to
remove this doubt it is necessary to call in a miracle to aid us or
else to say that all this water was evaporated by the heat of the
sun
footnote the passages here given from the ms leic have
hitherto remained unknown some preliminary notes on the subject are
to be found in ms f 8oa and 8ob but as compared with the fuller
treatment here given they are it seems to me of secondary
interest they contain nothing that is not repeated here more
clearly and fully libri histoire des sciences mathematiques iii
pages 218221 has printed the text of f 80a and 80b therefore it
seemed desirable to give my reasons for not inserting it in this
work
that marine shells could not go up the mountains
987
of the deluge and of marine shells
if you were to say that the shells which are to be seen within the
confines of italy now in our days far from the sea and at such
heights had been brought there by the deluge which left them there
i should answer that if you believe that this deluge rose 7 cubits
above the highest mountains as he who measured it has
writtenthese shells which always live near the seashore should
have been left on the mountains and not such a little way from the
foot of the mountains nor all at one level nor in layers upon
layers and if you were to say that these shells are desirous of
remaining near to the margin of the sea and that as it rose in
height the shells quitted their first home and followed the
increase of the waters up to their highest level to this i answer
that the cockle is an animal of not more rapid movement than the
snail is out of water or even somewhat slower because it does not
swim on the contrary it makes a furrow in the sand by means of its
sides and in this furrow it will travel each day from 3 to 4
braccia therefore this creature with so slow a motion could not
have travelled from the adriatic sea as far as monferrato in
lombardy footnote monferrato di lombardia the range of hills of
monferrato is in piedmont and casale di monferrato belonged in
leonardos time to the marchese di mantova which is 250 miles
distance in 40 days which he has said who took account of the
time and if you say that the waves carried them there by their
gravity they could not move excepting at the bottom and if you
will not grant me this confess at least that they would have to
stay at the summits of the highest mountains in the lakes which are
enclosed among the mountains like the lakes of lario or of como
and il maggiore footnote lago di lario lacus larius was the
name given by the romans to the lake of como it is evident that it
is here a slip of the pen since the the words in the ms are come
lago di lario ol magare e di como in the ms after line 16 we
come upon a digression treating of the weight of water this has
here been omitted it is 11 lines long and of fiesole and of
perugia and others
and if you should say that the shells were carried by the waves
being empty and dead i say that where the dead went they were not
far removed from the living for in these mountains living ones are
found which are recognisable by the shells being in pairs and they
are in a layer where there are no dead ones and a little higher up
they are found where they were thrown by the waves all the dead
ones with their shells separated near to where the rivers fell into
the sea to a great depth like the arno which fell from the
gonfolina near to monte lupo footnote monte lupo compare 970
13 it is between empoli and florence where it left a deposit of
gravel which may still be seen and which has agglomerated and of
stones of various districts natures and colours and hardness
making one single conglomerate and a little beyond the sandstone
conglomerate a tufa has been formed where it turned towards castel
florentino farther on the mud was deposited in which the shells
lived and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the
turbid arno flowed into that sea and from time to time the bottom
of the sea was raised depositing these shells in layers as may be
seen in the cutting at colle gonzoli laid open by the arno which is
wearing away the base of it in which cutting the said layers of
shells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour and
various marine objects are found there and if the earth of our
hemisphere is indeed raised by so much higher than it used to be it
must have become by so much lighter by the waters which it lost
through the rift between gibraltar and ceuta and all the more the
higher it rose because the weight of the waters which were thus
lost would be added to the earth in the other hemisphere and if the
shells had been carried by the muddy deluge they would have been
mixed up and separated from each other amidst the mud and not in
regular steps and layers as we see them now in our time
the marine shells were not produced away from the sea
988
as to those who say that shells existed for a long time and were
born at a distance from the sea from the nature of the place and of
the cycles which can influence a place to produce such
creaturesto them it may be answered such an influence could not
place the animals all on one line except those of the same sort and
age and not the old with the young nor some with an operculum and
others without their operculum nor some broken and others whole
nor some filled with seasand and large and small fragments of other
shells inside the whole shells which remained open nor the claws of
crabs without the rest of their bodies nor the shells of other
species stuck on to them like animals which have moved about on
them since the traces of their track still remain on the outside
after the manner of worms in the wood which they ate into nor would
there be found among them the bones and teeth of fish which some
call arrows and others serpents tongues nor would so many
footnote i scilla argued against this hypothesis which was still
accepted in his days see la vana speculazione napoli 1670
portions of various animals be found all together if they had not
been thrown on the sea shore and the deluge cannot have carried
them there because things that are heavier than water do not float
on the water but these things could not be at so great a height if
they had not been carried there by the water such a thing being
impossible from their weight in places where the valleys have not
been filled with salt sea water shells are never to be seen as is
plainly visible in the great valley of the arno above gonfolina a
rock formerly united to monte albano in the form of a very high
bank which kept the river pent up in such a way that before it
could flow into the sea which was afterwards at its foot it formed
two great lakes of which the first was where we now see the city of
florence together with prato and pistoia and monte albano it
followed the rest of its bank as far as where serravalle now stands
from the val darno upwards as far as arezzo another lake was
formed which discharged its waters into the former lake it was
closed at about the spot where now we see girone and occupied the
whole of that valley above for a distance of 40 miles in length
this valley received on its bottom all the soil brought down by the
turbid waters and this is still to be seen at the foot of prato
magno it there lies very high where the rivers have not worn it
away across this land are to be seen the deep cuts of the rivers
that have passed there falling from the great mountain of prato
magno in these cuts there are no vestiges of any shells or of
marine soil this lake was joined with that of perugia footnote
see pi cxiii
a great quantity of shells are to be seen where the rivers flow into
the sea because on such shores the waters are not so salt owing to
the admixture of the fresh water which is poured into it evidence
of this is to be seen where of old the appenines poured their
rivers into the adriatic sea for there in most places great
quantities of shells are to be found among the mountains together
with bluish marine clay and all the rocks which are torn off in
such places are full of shells the same may be observed to have
been done by the arno when it fell from the rock of gonfolina into
the sea which was not so very far below for at that time it was
higher than the top of san miniato al tedesco since at the highest
summit of this the shores may be seen full of shells and oysters
within its flanks the shells did not extend towards val di nievole
because the fresh waters of the arno did not extend so far
that the shells were not carried away from the sea by the deluge
because the waters which came from the earth although they drew the
sea towards the earth were those which struck its depths because
the water which goes down from the earth has a stronger current
than that of the sea and in consequence is more powerful and it
enters beneath the sea water and stirs the depths and carries with
it all sorts of movable objects which are to be found in the earth
such as the abovementioned shells and other similar things and in
proportion as the water which comes from the land is muddier than
sea water it is stronger and heavier than this therefore i see no
way of getting the said shells so far in land unless they had been
born there if you were to tell me that the river loire footnote
leonardo has written era instead of loera or loiraperhaps under
the mistaken idea that lo was an articlewhich traverses france
covers when the sea rises more than eighty miles of country because
it is a district of vast plains and the sea rises about 20 braccia
and shells are found in this plain at the distance of 80 miles from
the sea here i answer that the flow and ebb in our mediterranean
sea does not vary so much for at genoa it does not rise at all and
at venice but little and very little in africa and where it varies
little it covers but little of the country
the course of the water of a river always rises higher in a place
where the current is impeded it behaves as it does where it is
reduced in width to pass under the arches of a bridge

a confutation of those who say that shells may have been carried to
a distance of many days journey from the sea by the deluge which
was so high as to be above those heights
i say that the deluge could not carry objects native to the sea up
to the mountains unless the sea had already increased so as to
create inundations as high up as those places and this increase
could not have occurred because it would cause a vacuum and if you
were to say that the air would rush in there we have already
concluded that what is heavy cannot remain above what is light
whence of necessity we must conclude that this deluge was caused by
rain water so that all these waters ran to the sea and the sea did
not run up the mountains and as they ran to the sea they thrust
the shells from the shore of the sea and did not draw them to wards
themselves and if you were then to say that the sea raised by the
rain water had carried these shells to such a height we have
already said that things heavier than water cannot rise upon it but
remain at the bottom of it and do not move unless by the impact of
the waves and if you were to say that the waves had carried them to
such high spots we have proved that the waves in a great depth move
in a contrary direction at the bottom to the motion at the top and
this is shown by the turbidity of the sea from the earth washed down
near its shores anything which is lighter than the water moves with
the waves and is left on the highest level of the highest margin of
the waves anything which is heavier than the water moves suspended
in it between the surface and the bottom and from these two
conclusions which will be amply proved in their place we infer
that the waves of the surface cannot convey shells since they are
heavier than water
if the deluge had to carry shells three hundred and four hundred
miles from the sea it would have carried them mixed with various
other natural objects heaped together and we see at such distances
oysters all together and seasnails and cuttlefish and all the
other shells which congregate together all to be found together and
dead and the solitary shells are found wide apart from each other
as we may see them on seashores every day and if we find oysters
of very large shells joined together and among them very many which
still have the covering attached indicating that they were left
here by the sea and still living when the strait of gibraltar was
cut through there are to be seen in the mountains of parma and
piacenza a multitude of shells and corals full of holes and still
sticking to the rocks there when i was making the great horse for
milan a large sack full was brought to me in my workshop by certain
peasants these were found in that place and among them were many
preserved in their first freshness
under ground and under the foundations of buildings timbers are
found of wrought beams and already black such were found in my time
in those diggings at castel fiorentino and these had been in that
deep place before the sand carried by the arno into the sea then
covering the plain had heen raised to such a height and before the
plains of casentino had been so much lowered by the earth being
constantly carried down from them
footnote these lines are written in the margin
and if you were to say that these shells were created and were
continually being created in such places by the nature of the spot
and of the heavens which might have some influence there such an
opinion cannot exist in a brain of much reason because here are the
years of their growth numbered on their shells and there are large
and small ones to be seen which could not have grown without food
and could not have fed without motionand here they could not move
footnote these lines are written in the margin
990
that in the drifts among one and another there are still to be
found the traces of the worms which crawled upon them when they were
not yet dry and all marine clays still contain shells and the
shells are petrified together with the clay from their firmness and
unity some persons will have it that these animals were carried up
to places remote from the sea by the deluge another sect of
ignorant persons declare that nature or heaven created them in these
places by celestial influences as if in these places we did not
also find the bones of fishes which have taken a long time to grow
and as if we could not count in the shells of cockles and snails
the years and months of their life as we do in the horns of bulls
and oxen and in the branches of plants that have never been cut in
any part besides having proved by these signs the length of their
lives it is evident and it must be admitted that these animals
could not live without moving to fetch their food and we find in
them no instrument for penetrating the earth or the rock where we
find them enclosed but how could we find in a large snail shell the
fragments and portions of many other sorts of shells of various
sorts if they had not been thrown there when dead by the waves of
the sea like the other light objects which it throws on the earth
why do we find so many fragments and whole shells between layer and
layer of stone if this had not formerly been covered on the shore
by a layer of earth thrown up by the sea and which was afterwards
petrified and if the deluge before mentioned had carried them to
these parts of the sea you might find these shells at the boundary
of one drift but not at the boundary between many drifts we must
also account for the winters of the years during which the sea
multiplied the drifts of sand and mud brought down by the
neighbouring rivers by washing down the shores and if you chose to
say that there were several deluges to produce these rifts and the
shells among them you would also have to affirm that such a deluge
took place every year again among the fragments of these shells
it must be presumed that in those places there were sea coasts
where all the shells were thrown up broken and divided and never
in pairs since they are found alive in the sea with two valves
each serving as a lid to the other and in the drifts of rivers and
on the shores of the sea they are found in fragments and within the
limits of the separate strata of rocks they are found few in number
and in pairs like those which were left by the sea buried alive in
the mud which subsequently dried up and in time was petrified
991
and if you choose to say that it was the deluge which carried these
shells away from the sea for hundreds of miles this cannot have
happened since that deluge was caused by rain because rain
naturally forces the rivers to rush towards the sea with all the
things they carry with them and not to bear the dead things of the
sea shores to the mountains and if you choose to say that the
deluge afterwards rose with its waters above the mountains the
movement of the sea must have been so sluggish in its rise against
the currents of the rivers that it could not have carried floating
upon it things heavier than itself and even if it had supported
them in its receding it would have left them strewn about in
various spots but how are we to account for the corals which are
found every day towards monte ferrato in lombardy with the holes of
the worms in them sticking to rocks left uncovered by the currents
of rivers these rocks are all covered with stocks and families of
oysters which as we know never move but always remain with one of
their halves stuck to a rock and the other they open to feed
themselves on the animalcules that swim in the water which hoping
to find good feeding ground become the food of these shells we do
not find that the sand mixed with seaweed has been petrified
because the weed which was mingled with it has shrunk away and this
the po shows us every day in the debris of its banks
other problems 992994
992
why do we find the bones of great fishes and oysters and corals and
various other shells and seasnails on the high summits of mountains
by the sea just as we find them in low seas
993
you now have to prove that the shells cannot have originated if not
in salt water almost all being of that sort and that the shells in
lombardy are at four levels and thus it is everywhere having been
made at various times and they all occur in valleys that open
towards the seas
994
from the two lines of shells we are forced to say that the earth
indignantly submerged under the sea and so the first layer was made
and then the deluge made the second

topographical notes
a large part of the texts published in this section might perhaps
have found their proper place in connection with the foregoing
chapters on physical geography but these observations on physical
geography of whatever kind they may be as soon as they are
localised acquire a special interest and importance and particularly
as bearing on the question whether leonardo himself made the
observations recorded at the places mentioned or merely noted the
statements from hearsay in a few instances he himself tells us that
he writes at second hand in some cases again although the style
and expressions used make it seem highly probable that he has
derived his information from others though as it seems to me
these cases are not very numerouswe find on the other hand among
these topographical notes a great number of observations about
which it is extremely difficult to form a decided opinion of what
the masters life and travels may have been throughout his
sixtyseven years of life we know comparatively little for a long
course of time and particularly from about 1482 to 1486 we do not
even know with certainty that he was living in italy thus from a
biographical point of view a very great interest attaches to some of
the topographical notes and for this reason it seemed that it would
add to their value to arrange them in a group by themselves
leonardos intimate knowledge with places some of which were
certainly remote from his native home are of importance as
contributing to decide the still open question as to the extent of
leonardos travels we shall find in these notes a confirmation of
the view that the mss in which the topographical notes occur are
in only a very few instances such diaries as may have been in use
during a journey these notes are mostly found in the mss books of
his later and quieter years and it is certainly remarkable that
leonardo is very reticent as to the authorities from whom he quotes
his facts and observations for instance as to the straits of
gibraltar the nile the taurus mountains and the tigris and
euphrates is it likely that he who declared that in all scientific
research his own experience should be the foundation of his
statements see xix philosophy no 987991 should here have made
an exception to this rule without mentioning it
as for instance in the discussion as to the equilibrium of the mass
of water in the mediterranean seaa subject which it may be
observed had at that time attracted the interest and study of
hardly any other observer the acute remarks in nos 985993 on
the presence of shells at the tops of mountains suffice to
proveas it seems to methat it was not in his nature to allow
himself to be betrayed into wide generalisations extending beyond
the limits of his own investigations even by such brilliant results
of personal study
most of these topographical notes though suggesting very careful
and thorough research do not however as has been said afford
necessarily indisputable evidence that that research was leonardos
own but it must be granted that in more than one instance
probability is in favour of this idea
among the passages which treat somewhat fully of the topography of
eastern places by far the most interesting is a description of the
taurus mountains but as this text is written in the style of a
formal report and in the original is associated with certain
letters which give us the history of its origin i have thought it
best not to sever it from that connection it will be found under
no xxi letters
that florence and its neighbourhood where leonardo spent his
early years should be nowhere mentioned except in connection with
the projects for canals which occupied his attention for some short
time during the first ten years of the xvith century need not
surprise us the various passages relating to the construction of
canals in tuscany which are put together at the beginning are
immediately followed by those which deal with schemes for canals in
lombardy and after these come notes on the city and vicinity of
milan as well as on the lakes of north italy
the notes on some towns of central italy which leonardo visited in
1502 when in the service of cesare borgia are reproduced here in
the same order as in the note book used during these travels ms
l institut de france these notes have but little interest in
themselves excepting as suggesting his itinerary the maps of the
districts drawn by leonardo at the time are more valuable see no
1054 note the names on these maps are not written from right to
left but in the usual manner and we are permitted to infer that
they were made in obedience to some command possibly for the use of
cesare borgia himself the fact that they remained nevertheless in
leonardos hands is not surprising when we remember the sudden
political changes and warlike events of the period there can be no
doubt that these maps which are here published for the first time
are original in the strictest sense of the word that is to say
drawn from observations of the places themselves this is proved by
the factamong othersthat we find among his manuscripts not only
the finished maps themselves but the rough sketches and studies for
them and it would perhaps be difficult to point out among the
abundant contributions to geographical knowledge published during
the xvith century any maps at all approaching these in accuracy and
finish
the interesting map of the world so far as it was then known
which is among the leonardo mss at windsor published in the
archaeologia vol xi cannot be attributed to the master as the
marchese girolamo dadda has sufficiently proved it has not
therefore been reproduced here
such of leonardos observations on places in italy as were made
before or after his official travels as military engineer to cesare
borgia have been arranged in alphabetical order under nos
10341054 the most interesting are those which relate to the alps
and the appenines nos 10571068
most of the passages in which france is mentioned have hitherto
remained unknown as well as those which treat of the countries
bordering on the mediterranean which come at the end of this
section though these may be regarded as of a more questionable
importance in their bearing on the biography of the master than
those which mention places in france it must be allowed that they
are interesting as showing the prominent place which the countries
of the east held in his geographical studies he never once alludes

when in the summer the arno lacks water the canal may not remain
dry and let this canal be 20 braccia wide at the bottom and at the
top 30 and 2 braccia deep or 4 so that two of these braccia may
flow to the mills and the meadows which will benefit the country
and prato pistoia and pisa as well as florence will gain two
hundred thousand ducats a year and will lend a hand and money to
this useful work and the lucchese the same for the lake of sesto
will be navigable i shall direct it to prato and pistoia and cut
through serravalle and make an issue into the lake for there will
be no need of locks or supports which are not lasting and so will
always be giving trouble in working at them and keeping them up
and know that in digging this canal where it is 4 braccia deep it
will cost 4 dinari the square braccio for twice the depth 6 dinari

bottom of the trench to the surface of the edges of it and the
other from these edges to the top of the ridge of earth which will
be raised on the margin of the bank and if this bank were of double
the depth only the first bank will be increased that is 4 braccia
increased by half the first cost that is to say that if at first 4
dinari were paid for 2 banks for 3 it would come to 6 at 2 dinari
the bank if the trench measured 16 braccia at the bottom again if
the trench were 16 braccia wide and 4 deep coming to 4 lire for the

they do not know why the arno will never remain in a channel it is
because the rivers which flow into it deposit earth where they
enter and wear it away on the opposite side bending the river in
that direction the arno flows for 6 miles between la caprona and
leghorn and for 12 through the marshes which extend 32 miles and
16 from la caprona up the river which makes 48 by the arno from
florence beyond 16 miles to vico 16 miles and the canal is 5 from
florence to fucechio it is 40 miles by the river arno
56 miles by the arno from florence to vico by the pistoia canal it
is 44 miles thus it is 12 miles shorter by the canal than by the
arno

of the canal of martesana
by making the canal of martesana the water of the adda is greatly
diminished by its distribution over many districts for the
irrigation of the fields a remedy for this would be to make several
little channels since the water drunk up by the earth is of no more
use to any one nor mischief neither because it is taken from no
one and by making these channels the water which before was lost
returns again and is once more serviceable and useful to men
footnote el navilio di martagano is also mentioned in a note
written in red chalk ms h2 17a leonardo has as it seems little
to do with lodovico il moros scheme to render this canal navigable
the canal had been made in 1460 by bertonino da novara il moro
issued his degree in 1493 but leonardos notes about this canal
were with the exception of one no 1343 written about sixteen
years later

braccia deep at 4 dinari the square braccia it will only cost 900

in ordinary braccia but if the braccia are those used in measuring
land of which every 4 are equal to 4 12 and if by the mile we

amorettis views as to the mark on the ms and the date when it was
written are it may be observed wholly unfounded the ms l in
which it occurs is of the year 1502 and it is very unlikely that
leonardo was in milan at that time this however would not prevent
the remark which is somewhat obscure from applying to the
cathedral at milan
1020
of the force of the vacuum formed in a moment
i saw at milan a thunderbolt fall on the tower della credenza on
its northern side and it descended with a slow motion down that
side and then at once parted from that tower and carried with it
and tore away from that wall a space of 3 braccia wide and two deep
and this wall was 4 braccia thick and was built of thin and small
old bricks and this was dragged out by the vacuum which the flame
of the thunderbolt had caused c

remarks on natural phenomena in and near milan 1021 1022
1021
i have already been to see a great variety of atmospheric effects
and lately over milan towards lago maggiore i saw a cloud in the
form of an immense mountain full of rifts of glowing light because
the rays of the sun which was already close to the horizon and red
tinged the cloud with its own hue and this cloud attracted to it
all the little clouds that were near while the large one did not
move from its place thus it retained on its summit the reflection
of the sunlight till an hour and a half after sunset so immensely
large was it and about two hours after sunset such a violent wind
arose that it was really tremendous and unheard of
footnote di arie is wanting in the original but may safely be
inserted in the context as the formation of clouds is under

again if the lowest part of the bank which lies across the current
of the waters is made in deep and wide steps after the manner of
stairs the waters which in their course usually fall
perpendicularly from the top of such a place to the bottom and wear
away the foundations of this bank can no longer descend with a blow
of too great a force and i find the example of this in the stairs
down which the water falls in the fields at sforzesca at vigevano
over which the running water falls for a height of 50 braccia

filled it up and a pool of great depth has been turned into meadows
notes on the north italian lake 10291033
1029
in many places there are streams of water which swell for six hours
and ebb for six hours and i for my part have seen one above the
lake of como called fonte pliniana which increases and ebbs as i
have said in such a way as to turn the stones of two mills and
when it fails it falls so low that it is like looking at water in a
deep pit
footnote the fountain is known by this name to this day it is
near torno on the eastern shore of como the waters still rise and
fall with the flow and ebb of the tide as pliny described it epist

lake of como valley of chiavenna
above the lake of como towards germany is the valley of chiavenna
where the river mera flows into this lake here are barren and very
high mountains with huge rocks among these mountains are to be
found the waterbirds called gulls here grow fir trees larches and
pines deer wildgoats chamois and terrible bears it is
impossible to climb them without using hands and feet the peasants
go there at the time of the snows with great snares to make the
bears fall down these rocks these mountains which very closely
approach each other are parted by the river they are to the right
and left for the distance of 20 miles throughout of the same nature
from mile to mile there are good inns above on the said river there
are waterfalls of 400 braccia in height which are fine to see and
there is good living at 4 soldi the reckoning this river brings
down a great deal of timber
val sasina
val sasina runs down towards italy this is almost the same form and
character there grow here many mappello and there are great ruins
and falls of water footnote 14 the meaning of mappello is
unknown
valley of introzzo
this valley produces a great quantity of firs pines and larches
and from here ambrogio fereri has his timber brought down at the
head of the valtellina are the mountains of bormio terrible and
always covered with snow marmots  are found there
bellaggio
opposite the castle bellaggio there is the river latte which falls
from a height of more than 100 braccia from the source whence it
springs perpendicularly into the lake with an inconceivable roar
and noise this spring flows only in august and september
valtellina
valtellina as it is called is a valley enclosed in high and
terrible mountains it produces much strong wine and there is so
much cattle that the natives conclude that more milk than wine grows
there this is the valley through which the adda passes which first
runs more than 40 miles through germany this river breeds the fish
temolo which live on silver of which much is to be found in its
sands in this country every one can sell bread and wine and the
wine is worth at most one soldo the bottle and a pound of veal one
soldo and salt ten dinari and butter the same and their pound is 30
ounces and eggs are one soldo the lot
1031
at bormio
at bormio are the bathsabout eight miles above como is the
pliniana which increases and ebbs every six hours and its swell
supplies water for two mills and its ebbing makes the spring dry
up two miles higher up there is nesso a place where a river falls
with great violence into a vast rift in the mountain these
excursions are to be made in the month of may and the largest bare
rocks that are to be found in this part of the country are the
mountains of mandello near to those of lecco and of gravidona
towards bellinzona 30 miles from lecco and those of the valley of
chiavenna but the greatest of all is that of mandello which has at
its base an opening towards the lake which goes down 200 steps and
there at all times is ice and wind
in val sasina
in val sasina between vimognio and introbbio to the right hand
going in by the road to lecco is the river troggia which falls from
a very high rock and as it falls it goes underground and the river
ends there 3 miles farther we find the buildings of the mines of
copper and silver near a place called pra santo pietro and mines
of iron and curious things la grigna is the highest mountain there
is in this part and it is quite bare
footnote 1030 and 1031 from the character of the handwriting we
may conclude that these observations were made in leonardos youth
and i should infer from their contents that they were notes made in
anticipation of a visit to the places here described and derived
from some person unknown to us who had given him an account of
them
1032
the lake of pusiano flows into the lake of segrino footnote 3 the
statement about the lake segrino is incorrect it is situated in the
valle assina above the lake of pusiano and of annone and of sala
the lake of annone is 22 braccia higher at the surface of its water
than the surface of the water of the lake of lecco and the lake of
pusiano is 20 braccia higher than the lake of annone which added to
the afore said 22 braccia make 42 braccia and this is the greatest
height of the surface of the lake of pusiano above the surface of
the lake of lecco

at the beginning of october 1502 cesare borgia was shut up in imola
by a sudden revolt of the condottieri and it was some weeks before
he could release himself from this state of siege see gregorovius
geschichte der stadt rom im mittelalter vol vii book xiii 5
5
besides this incident imola plays no important part in the history
of the time i therefore think myself fully justified in connecting
this map which is at windsor with the siege of 1502 and with
leonardos engagements in the service of cesare borgia because a
comparison of these texts nos 1050 and 1051 raise i believe the
hypothesis to a certainty

towards you footnote this passage evidently refers to the making
of maps such as pl cxii cxiii and cxiv there is no mention of
such works it is true excepting in this one passage of ms l but
this can scarcely be taken as evidence against my view that leonardo
busied himself very extensively at that time in the construction of
maps and all the less since the foregoing chapters clearly prove
that at a time so full of events leonardo would only now and then
commit his observations to paper in the ms l
by the side of this text we find in the original a very indistinct
sketch perhaps a plan of a position instead of this drawing i have

at monbracco above saluzzoa mile above the certosa at the foot

as carrara marble without a spot and as hard as porphyry or even
harder of which my worthy gossip master benedetto the sculptor
has promised to give me a small slab for the colours the second
day of january 1511
footnote saluzzo at the foot of the alps south of turin
footnote 9 10 maestro benedetto scultore probably some native
of northern italy acquainted with the place here described hardly
the florentine sculptor benedetto da majano amoretti had published
this passage and m ravaisson who gave a french translation of it
in the gazette des beaux arts 1881 pag 528 remarks as
follows le maitre sculpteur que leonard appelle son compare ne
seraitil pas benedetto da majano un de ceux qui jugerent avec lui
de la place a donner au david de michelange et de qui le louvre a
acquis recemment un buste dapres philippe strozzi to this it may
be objected that benedetto da majano had already lain in his grave
fourteen years in the year 1511 when he is supposed to have given
the promise to leonardo the colours may have been given to the
sculptor benedetto and the stone may have been in payment for them
from the description of the stone here given we may conclude that it
is repeated from hearsay of the sculptors account of it i do not
understand how from this observation it is possible to conclude
that leonardo was on the spot
1058
that there are springs which suddenly break forth in earthquakes or
other convulsions and suddenly fail and this happened in a mountain
in savoy where certain forests sank in and left a very deep gap and
about four miles from here the earth opened itself like a gulf in
the mountain and threw out a sudden and immense flood of water
which scoured the whole of a little valley of the tilled soil
vineyards and houses and did the greatest mischief wherever it
overflowed

fair is held on midsummerday in the village of saint gervais

and this may be seen as i saw it by any one going up monbroso
footnote i have vainly enquired of every available authority for a
solution of the mystery as to what mountain is intended by the name
monboso comp vol i nos 300 and 301 it seems most obvious to
refer it to monte rosa rosa derived from the keltic ros which
survives in breton and in gaelic meaning in its first sense a
mountain spur but which alsolike hornmeans a very high peak
thus monte rosa would mean literally the high peak a peak of the
alps which divide france from italy the base of this mountain gives
birth to the 4 rivers which flow in four different directions
through the whole of europe and no mountain has its base at so
great a height as this which lifts itself above almost all the
clouds and snow seldom falls there but only hail in the summer
when the clouds are highest and this hail lies unmelted there so
that if it were not for the absorption of the rising and falling
clouds which does not happen more than twice in an age an enormous
mass of ice would be piled up there by the layers of hail and in
the middle of july i found it very considerable and i saw the sky
above me quite dark and the sun as it fell on the mountain was far
brighter here than in the plains below because a smaller extent of
atmosphere lay between the summit of the mountain and the sun

leonardos part and should be read estate summer

in the mountains of verona the red marble is found all mixed with
cockle shells turned into stone some of them have been filled at
the mouth with the cement which is the substance of the stone and
in some parts they have remained separate from the mass of the rock
which enclosed them because the outer covering of the shell had
interposed and had not allowed them to unite with it while in other
places this cement had petrified those which were old and almost
stripped the outer skin

that part of the earth which was lightest remained farthest from the
centre of the world and that part of the earth became the lightest
over which the greatest quantity of water flowed and therefore that
part became lightest where the greatest number of rivers flow like
the alps which divide germany and france from italy whence issue
the rhone flowing southwards and the rhine to the north the danube
or tanoia towards the north east and the po to the east with
innumerable rivers which join them and which always run turbid with
the soil carried by them to the sea
the shores of the sea are constantly moving towards the middle of
the sea and displace it from its original position the lowest
portion of the mediterranean will be reserved for the bed and
current of the nile the largest river that flows into that sea and
with it are grouped all its tributaries which at first fell into
the sea as may be seen with the po and its tributaries which first
fell into that sea which between the appenines and the german alps
was united to the adriatic sea
that the gallic alps are the highest part of europe

a spring may be seen to rise in sicily which at certain times of the

the river loire at amboise
the river is higher within the bank b d than outside that bank
the island where there is a part of amboise
this is the river that passes through amboise it passes at a b c

original current by the channel d e b f in contact with the
bank which lies between the two contrary currents of the said river
a b c d and d e b f it then turns down again by the
channel f l g h n m and reunites with the river from which
it was at first separated which passes by k n which makes k m

the water may be dammed up above the level of romorantin to such a
height that in its fall it may be used for numerous mills

be done by the inhabitants and the timber of which their houses are

may be brought back to romorantin with a convenient fall
1076
as to whether it is better that the water should all be raised in a
single turn or in two
the answer is that in one single turn the wheel could not support
all the water that it can raise in two turns because at the half
turn of the wheel it would be raising 100 pounds and no more and if
it had to raise the whole 200 pounds in one turn it could not
raise them unless the wheel were of double the diameter and if the
diameter were doubled the time of its revolution would be doubled
therefore it is better and a greater advantage in expense to make
such a wheel of half the size  the land which it would water and
would render the country fertile to supply food to the inhabitants
and would make navigable canals for mercantile purposes
the way in which the river in its flow should scour its own channel
by the ninth of the third the more rapid it is the more it wears
away its channel and by the converse proposition the slower the
water the more it deposits that which renders it turbid
and let the sluice be movable like the one i arranged in friuli
footnote 19 this passage reveals to us the fact that leonardo had
visited the country of friuli and that he had stayed there for some
time nothing whatever was known of this previously where when
one sluice was opened the water which passed through it dug out the
bottom therefore when the rivers are flooded the sluices of the
mills ought to be opened in order that the whole course of the river
may pass through falls to each mill there should be many in order
to give a greater impetus and so all the river will be scoured and
below the site of each of the two mills there may be one of the said
sluice falls one of them may be placed below each mill
1078
a trabocco is four braccia and one mile is three thousand of the
said braccia each braccio is divided into 12 inches and the water
in the canals has a fall in every hundred trabocchi of two of these
inches therefore 14 inches of fall are necessary in two thousand
eight hundred braccia of flow in these canals it follows that 15
inches of fall give the required momentum to the currents of the
waters in the said canals that is one braccio and a half in the
mile and from this it may be concluded that the water taken from
the river of villefranche and lent to the river of romorantin
will where one river by reason of its low level cannot flow
into the other it will be necessary to dam it up so that it may
acquire a fall into the other which was previously the higher

that the valleys were formerly in great part covered by lakes the
soil of which always forms the banks of riversand by seas which
afterwards by the persistent wearing of the rivers cut through the

mountains is evident from the strata in the rocks which correspond
in their sections as made by the courses of the rivers footnote 4

and going on still to the west they change to mount ocra in the

to the west above italy they join the adula where the danube rises

shortest line is about l000 miles and the same or about the same is
that branch of the adula mountains changed as to their name as
before mentioned to the north are the carpathians closing in the
breadth of the valley of the danube which as i have said extends
eastward a length of about 1000 miles and is sometimes 200 and in
some places 300 miles wide and in the midst flows the danube the
principal river of europe as to size the said danube runs through
the middle of austria and albania and northwards through bavaria
poland hungary wallachia and bosnia and then the danube or donau
flows into the black sea which formerly extended almost to austria
and occupied the plains through which the danube now courses and
the evidence of this is in the oysters and cockle shells and
scollops and bones of great fishes which are still to be found in
many places on the sides of those mountains and this sea was formed
by the filling up of the spurs of the adula mountains which then
extended to the east joining the spurs of the taurus which extend to
the west and near bithynia the waters of this black sea poured into
the propontis marmora falling into the aegean sea that is the
mediterranean where after a long course the spurs of the adula
mountains became separated from those of the taurus the black sea
sank lower and laid bare the valley of the danube with the above
named countries and the whole of asia minor beyond the taurus range
to the north and the plains from mount caucasus to the black sea to
the west and the plains of the don this sidethat is to say at
the foot of the ural mountains and thus the black sea must have
sunk about 1000 braccia to uncover such vast plains

the countries of the western end of the mediterranean
the straits of gibraltar 10831085
1083
why the sea makes a stronger current in the straits of spain than
elsewhere
a river of equal depth runs with greater speed in a narrow space
than in a wide one in proportion to the difference between the
wider and the narrower one
this proposition is clearly proved by reason confirmed by
experiment supposing that through a channel one mile wide there
flows one mile in length of water where the river is five miles
wide each of the 5 square miles will require 15 of itself to be
equal to the square mile of water required in the sea and where the
river is 3 miles wide each of these square miles will require the
third of its volume to make up the amount of the square mile of the
narrow part as is demonstrated in f g h at the mile marked n
footnote in the place marked a in the diagram mare mediterano
mediterranean sea is written in the original and at b stretto
di spugna straits of spain ie gibraltar compare no 960
1084
why the current of gibraltar is always greater to the west than to
the east
the reason is that if you put together the mouths of the rivers
which discharge into the mediterranean sea you would find the sum
of water to be larger than that which this sea pours through the
straits into the ocean you see africa discharging its rivers that
run northwards into this sea and among them the nile which runs
through 3000 miles of africa there is also the bagrada river and
the schelif and others footnote 5 bagrada leonardo writes
bragada in tunis now medscherda mavretano now schelif
likewise europe pours into it the don and the danube the po the
rhone the arno and the tiber so that evidently these rivers with
an infinite number of others of less fame make its great breadth
and depth and current and the sea is not wider than 18 miles at the
most westerly point of land where it divides europe from africa
1085
the gulf of the mediterranean as an inland sea received the
principal waters of africa asia and europe that flowed towards it
and its waters came up to the foot of the mountains that surrounded
it and made its shores and the summits of the apennines stood up
out of this sea like islands surrounded by salt water africa
again behind its atlas mountains did not expose uncovered to the
sky the surface of its vast plains about 3000 miles in length and

some at the tyrrhene sea employ this method that is to say they
fastened an anchor to one end of the yard and to the other a cord
of which the lower end was fastened to an anchor and in battle they
flung this anchor on to the oars of the opponents boat and by the
use of a capstan drew it to the side and threw soft soap and tow
daubed with pitch and set ablaze on to that side where the anchor
hung so that in order to escape that fire the defenders of that
ship had to fly to the opposite side and in doing this they aided
to the attack because the galley was more easily drawn to the side
by reason of the counterpoise footnote this text is illustrated

the levant
the levantine sea
1090
on the shores of the mediterranean 300 rivers flow and 40 200
ports and this sea is 3000 miles long many times has the increase
of its waters heaped up by their backward flow and the blowing of
the west winds caused the overflow of the nile and of the rivers
which flow out through the black sea and have so much raised the
seas that they have spread with vast floods over many countries and
these floods take place at the time when the sun melts the snows on
the high mountains of ethiopia that rise up into the cold regions of
the air and in the same way the approach of the sun acts on the
mountains of sarmatia in asia and on those in europe so that the
gathering together of these three things are and always have been
the cause of tremendous floods that is the return flow of the sea
with the west wind and the melting of the snows so every river will
overflow in syria in samaria in judea between sinai and the
lebanon and in the rest of syria between the lebanon and the taurus
mountains and in cilicia in the armenian mountains and in
pamphilia and in lycia within the hills and in egypt as far as the
atlas mountains the gulf of persia which was formerly a vast lake
of the tigris and discharged into the indian sea has now worn away
the mountains which formed its banks and laid them even with the
level of the indian ocean and if the mediterranean had continued
its flow through the gulf of arabia it would have done the same
that is to say would have reduced the level of the mediterranean to
that of the indian sea
the red sea 1091 1092
1091
for a long time the water of the mediterranean flowed out through
the red sea which is 100 miles wide and 1500 long and full of
reefs and it has worn away the sides of mount sinai a fact which
testifies not to an inundation from the indian sea beating on these
coasts but to a deluge of water which carried with it all the
rivers which abound round the mediterranean and besides this there
is the reflux of the sea and then a cutting being made to the west
3000 miles away from this place gibraltar was separated from ceuta
which had been joined to it and this passage was cut very low down
in the plains between gibraltar and the ocean at the foot of the
mountain in the low part aided by the hollowing out of some
valleys made by certain rivers which might have flowed here
hercules footnote 9 leonardo seems here to mention hercules half
jestingly and only in order to suggest to the reader an allusion to
the legend of the pillars of hercules came to open the sea to the
westward and then the sea waters began to pour into the western
ocean and in consequence of this great fall the red sea remained
the higher whence the water abandoning its course here ever after
poured away through the straits of spain
1092
the surface of the red sea is on a level with the ocean
a mountain may have fallen and closed the mouth of the red sea and
prevented the outlet of the mediterranean and the mediterranean sea
thus overfilled had for outlet the passage below the mountains of
gades for in our own times a similar thing has been seen footnote

celebrated historian born at como in 1483 reports that in 1513 at

and closed it up and made a lake and thus most lakes have been made
by mountains as the lake of garda the lakes of como and lugano
and the lago maggiore the mediterranean fell but little on the
confines of syria in consequence of the gaditanean passage but a
great deal in this passage because before this cutting was made the
mediterranean sea flowed to the south east and then the fall had to
be made by its run through the straits of gades
at a the water of the mediterranean fell into the ocean
all the plains which lie between the sea and mountains were formerly
covered with salt water
every valley has been made by its own river and the proportion
between valleys is the same as that between river and river
the greatest river in our world is the mediterranean river which
moves from the sources of the nile to the western ocean
and its greatest height is in outer mauritania and it has a course
of ten thousand miles before it reunites with its ocean the father
of the waters
that is 3000 miles for the mediterranean 3000 for the nile as far
as discovered and 3000 for the nile which flows to the east c
footnote see pl cxi 2 a sketch of the shores of the
mediterranean sea where lines 11 to 16 may be seen the large

therefore we must conclude those mountains to be of the greatest
height above which the clouds falling in snow give rise to the
nile
1094
the egyptians the ethiopians and the arabs in crossing the nile
with camels are accustomed to attach two bags on the sides of the
camels bodies that is skins in the form shown underneath
in these four meshes of the net the camels for baggage place their
feet

the tigris passes through asia minor and brings with it the water of
three lakes one after the other of various elevations the first
being munace and the middle pallas and the lowest triton and the
nile again springs from three very high lakes in ethiopia and runs
northwards towards the sea of egypt with a course of 4000 miles and
by the shortest and straightest line it is 3000 miles it is said
that it issues from the mountains of the moon and has various
unknown sources the said lakes are about 4000 braccia above the
surface of the sphere of water that is 1 mile and 13 giving to
the nile a fall of 1 braccia in every mile
footnote 5 incogniti principio the affluents of the lakes are
probably here intended compare as to the nile nos 970 1063 and
1084
1096
very many times the nile and other very large rivers have poured out
their whole element of water and restored it to the sea
1097
why does the inundation of the nile occur in the summer coming from
torrid countries
1098
it is not denied that the nile is constantly muddy in entering the
egyptian sea and that its turbidity is caused by soil that this
river is continually bringing from the places it passes which soil
never returns in the sea which receives it unless it throws it on
its shores you see the sandy desert beyond mount atlas where
formerly it was covered with salt water
customs of asiatic nations 1099 1100

the assyrians and the people of euboea accustom their horses to
carry sacks which they can at pleasure fill with air and which in
case of need they carry instead of the girth of the saddle above and
at the side and they are well covered with plates of cuir bouilli
in order that they may not be perforated by flights of arrows thus
they have not on their minds their security in flight when the
victory is uncertain a horse thus equipped enables four or five men
to cross over at need

small boats
the small boats used by the assyrians were made of thin laths of
willow plaited over rods also of willow and bent into the form of a
boat they were daubed with fine mud soaked with oil or with
turpentine and reduced to a kind of mud which resisted the water
and because pine would split and always remained fresh and they
covered this sort of boats with the skins of oxen in safely crossing
the river sicuris of spain as is reported by lucant footnote 7

in fourteen hundred and eighty nine there was an earthquake in the
sea of atalia near rhodes which opened the seathat is its
bottomand into this opening such a torrent of water poured that
for more than three hours the bottom of the sea was uncovered by
reason of the water which was lost in it and then it closed to the
former level
footnote nello ottanto 9 it is scarcely likely that leonardo
should here mean 89 ad dr h muller strubing writes to me as
follows on this subject with reference to rhodes ross says reise
auf den griechischen inseln iii 70 ff 1840 that ancient
history affords instances of severe earthquakes at rhodes among
others one in the second year of the 138th olympiad270 b c a
remarkably violent one under antoninus pius a d 138161 and
again under constantine and later but leonardo expressly speaks of
an earthquake nel mar di atalia presso a rodi which is
singular the town of attalia founded by attalus which is what he
no doubt means was in pamphylia and more than 150 english miles
east of rhodes in a straight line leake and most other geographers
identify it with the present town of adalia attalia is rarely
mentioned by the ancients indeed only by strabo and pliny and no
earthquake is spoken of i think therefore you are justified in
assuming that leonardo means 1489 in the elaborate catalogue of
earthquakes in the east by sciale dshelal eddin sayouthy an
unpublished arabic ms in the possession of prof schefer membre
de linstitut paris mention is made of a terrible earthquake in
the year 867 of the mohamedan era corresponding to the year 1489

place of aphrodite kirpic in homer
in which the water may fall into various vases of granite
porphyryand serpentine within semicircular recesses and the water
may overflow from these and round this portico towards the north
there should be a lake with a little island in the midst of which
should be a thick and shady wood the waters at the top of the
pilasters should pour into vases at their base from whence they
should flow in little channels

from the shore of the southern coast of cilicia may be seen to the
south the beautiful island of cyprus which was the realm of the
goddess venus and many navigators being attracted by her beauty
had their ships and rigging broken amidst the reefs surrounded by
the whirling waters here the beauty of delightful hills tempts
wandering mariners to refresh themselves amidst their flowery
verdure where the winds are tempered and fill the island and the
surrounding seas with fragrant odours ah how many a ship has here
been sunk ah how many a vessel broken on these rocks here might
be seen barks without number some wrecked and half covered by the
sand others showing the poop and another the prow here a keel and

1106
why water is found at the top of mountains
from the straits of gibraltar to the don is 3500 miles that is one
mile and 16 giving a fall of one braccio in a mile to any water
that moves gently the caspian sea is a great deal higher and none
of the mountains of europe rise a mile above the surface of our
seas therefore it might be said that the water which is on the
summits of our mountains might come from the height of those seas
and of the rivers which flow into them and which are still higher
the sea of azov
1107
hence it follows that the sea of azov is the highest part of the
mediterranean sea being at a distance of 3500 miles from the
straits of gibraltar as is shown by the map for navigation and it
has 3500 braccia of descent that is one mile and 16 therefore it
is higher than any mountains which exist in the west
footnote the passage before this in the original treats of the
exit of the waters from lakes in general
the dardanelles
1108
in the bosphorus the black sea flows always into the egean sea and
the egean sea never flows into it and this is because the caspian
which is 400 miles to the east with the rivers which pour into it
always flows through subterranean caves into this sea of pontus and
the don does the same as well as the danube so that the waters of
pontus are always higher than those of the egean for the higher
always fall towards the lower and never the lower towards the
higher

tributaries in this course the rivers xaradrus hyphasis vadris

with these rivers and with their waters it flows 800 miles to the
west then turning back by the arbiti mountains makes an elbow and
turns southwards where after a course of about 100 miles it finds
the indian sea in which it pours itself by seven branches on the
side of the same mountains rises the great ganges which river flows

such theoretical questions as have been laid before the reader in
sections xvi and xvii though they were the chief subjects of
leonardos studies of the sea did not exclusively claim his
attention a few passages have been collected at the beginning of
this section which prove that he had turned his mind to the
practical problems of navigation and more especially of naval
warfare what we know for certain of his life gives us no data it
is true as to when or where these matters came under his
consideration but the fact remains certain both from these notes in
his manuscripts and from the well known letter to ludovico il moro
no 1340 in which he expressly states that he is as capable as
any man in this very department
the numerous notes as to the laws and rationale of the flight of
birds are scattered through several notebooks an account of these
is given in the bibliography of the manuscripts at the end of this
work it seems probable that the idea which led him to these
investigations was his desire to construct a flying or aerial
machine for man at the same time it must be admitted that the notes
on the two subjects are quite unconnected in the manuscripts and
that those on the flight of birds are by far the most numerous and
extensive the two most important passages that treat of the
construction of a flying machine are those already published as tav
xvi no 1 and tav xviii in the saggio delle opere di leonardo
da vinci milan 1872 the passagesnos 11201125here
printed for the first time and hitherto unknownrefer to the same
subject and with the exception of one already published in the
saggio no 1126they are so far as i know the only notes
among the numerous observations on the flight of birds in which the
phenomena are incidentally and expressly connected with the idea of
a flying machine
the notes on machines of war the construction of fortifications
and similar matters which fall within the department of the
engineer have not been included in this work for the reasons given
on page 26 of this vol an exception has been made in favour of
the passages nos 1127 and 1128 because they have a more
general interest as bearing on the important question whence the
master derived his knowledge of these matters though it would be
rash to assert that leonardo was the first to introduce the science
of mining into italy it may be confidently said that he is one of
the earliest writers who can be proved to have known and understood
it while on the other hand it is almost beyond doubt that in the
east at that time the whole science of besieging towns and mining
in particular was far more advanced than in europe this gives a
peculiar value to the expressions used in no 1127
i have been unable to find in the manuscripts any passage whatever
which throws any light on leonardos great reputation as a musician
nothing therein illustrates vasarps wellknown statement avvenne

on movementsto know how much a ship advances in an hour
the ancients used various devices to ascertain the distance gone by
a ship each hour among which vitruvius footnote 6 see vitruvius
de architectura lib x c 14 p 264 in the edition of rose and
muller strubing the german edition published at bale in 1543 has
on fol 596 an illustration of the contrivance as described by
vitruvius gives one in his work on architecture which is just as
fallacious as all the others and this is a mill wheel which touches
the waves of the sea at one end and in each complete revolution
describes a straight line which represents the circumference of the
wheel extended to a straightness but this invention is of no worth
excepting on the smooth and motionless surface of lakes but if the
water moves together with the ship at an equal rate then the wheel
remains motionless and if the motion of the water is more or less
rapid than that of the ship then neither has the wheel the same
motion as the ship so that this invention is of but little use
there is another method tried by experiment with a known distance
between one island and another and this is done by a board or under
the pressure of wind which strikes on it with more or less
swiftness this is in battista alberti footnote 25 leon battista
alberti de architectura lib v c 12 treats de le navi e
parti loro but there is no reference to the machine mentioned by
leonardo alberti says here noi abbiamo trattato lungamente in
altro luogo de modi de le navi ma in questo luogo ne abbiamo detto
quel tanto che si bisogna to this the following note is added in
the most recent italian edition questo libro e tuttora inedito e
porta il titolo secondo gesnero di liber navis
battista albertis method which is made by experiment on a known
distance between one island and another but such an invention does
not succeed excepting on a ship like the one on which the experiment
was made and it must be of the same burden and have the same sails
and the sails in the same places and the size of the waves must be
the same but my method will serve for any ship whether with oars
or sails and whether it be small or large broad or long or high
or low it always serves footnote 52 leonardo does not reveal the
method invented by him

jump out of the water as may be seen with dolphins and it seems a
wonderful thing to make a leap from a thing which does not resist
but slips away of the swimming of animals of a long form such as
eels and the like of the mode of swimming against currents and in
the rapid falls of rivers of the mode of swimming of fishes of a
round form how it is that animals which have not long hind quartres
cannot swim how it is that all other animals which have feet with
toes know by nature how to swim excepting man in what way man
ought to learn to swim of the way in which man may rest on the
water how man may protect himself against whirlpools or eddies in
the water which drag him down how a man dragged to the bottom must
seek the reflux which will throw him up from the depths how he
ought to move his arms how to swim on his back how he can and how
he cannot stay under water unless he can hold his breath 13 how
by means of a certain machine many people may stay some time under
water how and why i do not describe my method of remaining under
water or how long i can stay without eating and i do not publish
nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who would use
them as means of destruction at the bottom of the sea by sending
ships to the bottom and sinking them together with the men in them
and although i will impart others there is no danger in them
because the mouth of the tube by which you breathe is above the
water supported on bags or corks 19

supposing in a battle between ships and galleys that the ships are
victorious by reason of the high of heir tops you must haul the
yard up almost to the top of the mast and at the extremity of the
yard that is the end which is turned towards the enemy have a
small cage fastened wrapped up below and all round in a great
mattress full of cotton so that it may not be injured by the bombs
then with the capstan haul down the opposite end of this yard and
the top on the opposite side will go up so high that it will be far
above the roundtop of the ship and you will easily drive out the
men that are in it but it is necessary that the men who are in the
galley should go to the opposite side of it so as to afford a
counterpoise to the weight of the men placed inside the cage on the
yard
1116
if you want to build an armada for the sea employ these ships to ram
in the enemys ships that is make ships 100 feet long and 8 feet
wide but arranged so that the left hand rowers may have their oars
to the right side of the ship and the right hand ones to the left
side as is shown at m so that the leverage of the oars may be
longer and the said ship may be one foot and a half thick that is
made with cross beams within and without with planks in contrary
directions and this ship must have attached to it a foot below the
water an ironshod spike of about the weight and size of an anvil
and this by force of oars may after it has given the first blow
be drawn back and driven forward again with fury give a second
blow and then a third and so many as to destroy the other ship

a method of escaping in a tempest and shipwreck at sea
have a coat made of leather which must be double across the breast
that is having a hem on each side of about a finger breadth thus it
will be double from the waist to the knee and the leather must be
quite airtight when you want to leap into the sea blow out the
skirt of your coat through the double hems of the breast and jump
into the sea and allow yourself to be carried by the waves when
you see no shore near give your attention to the sea you are in
and always keep in your mouth the airtube which leads down into the
coat and if now and again you require to take a breath of fresh
air and the foam prevents you you may draw a breath of the air
within the coat

man when flying must stand free from the waist upwards so as to be
able to balance himself as he does in a boat so that the centre of
gravity in himself and in the machine may counterbalance each other
and be shifted as necessity demands for the changes of its centre of
resistance
1123
remember that your flying machine must imitate no other than the
bat because the web is what by its union gives the armour or
strength to the wings
if you imitate the wings of feathered birds you will find a much
stronger structure because they are pervious that is their
feathers are separate and the air passes through them but the bat
is aided by the web that connects the whole and is not pervious
1124
to escape the peril of destruction
destruction to such a machine may occur in two ways of which the
first is the breaking of the machine the second would be when the
machine should turn on its edge or nearly on its edge because it
ought always to descend in a highly oblique direction and almost
exactly balanced on its centre as regards the firstthe breaking
of the machine that may be prevented by making it as strong as
possible and in whichever direction it may tend to turn over one
centre must be very far from the other that is in a machine 30
braccia long the centres must be 4 braccia one from the other

an object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to
the object you may see that the beating of its wings against the
air supports a heavy eagle in the highest and rarest atmosphere
close to the sphere of elemental fire again you may see the air in
motion over the sea fill the swelling sails and drive heavily laden
ships from these instances and the reasons given a man with wings
large enough and duly connected might learn to overcome the
resistance of the air and by conquering it succeed in subjugating
it and rising above it footnote a parachute is here sketched

1127
if you want to know where a mine runs place a drum over all the
places where you suspect that it is being made and upon this drum
put a couple of dice and when you are over the spot where they are
mining the dice will jump a little on the drum at every blow which
is given underground in the mining
there are persons who having the convenience of a river or a lake
in their lands have made close to the place where they suspect
that a mine is being made a great reservoir of water and have
countermined the enemy and having found them have turned the water
upon them and destroyed a great number in the mine

greek fire
take charcoal of willow and saltpetre and sulphuric acid and
sulphur and pitch with frankincense and camphor and ethiopian
wool and boil them all together this fire is so ready to burn that
it clings to the timbers even under water and add to this
composition liquid varnish and bituminous oil and turpentine and
strong vinegar and mix all together and dry it in the sun or in an
oven when the bread is taken out and then stick it round hempen or
other tow moulding it into a round form and studding it all over
with very sharp nails you must leave in this ball an opening to
serve as a fusee and cover it with rosin and sulphur
again this fire stuck at the top of a long plank which has one
braccio length of the end pointed with iron that it may not be burnt
by the said fire is good for avoiding and keeping off the ships so
as not to be overwhelmed by their onset
again throw vessels of glass full of pitch on to the enemys ships
when the men in them are intent on the battle and then by throwing
similar burning balls upon them you have it in your power to burn
all their ships

philosophical maxims morals polemics and speculations
vasari indulges in severe strictures on leonardos religious views
he speaks among other things of his capricci nel filosofar delle
cose naturali and says on this point per il che fece nellanimo
un concetto si eretico che e non si accostava a qualsi voglia
religione stimando per avventura assai piu lo esser filosofo che
cristiano see the first edition of le vite but this
accusation on the part of a writer in the days of the inquisition is
not a very serious oneand the less so since throughout the
manuscripts we find nothing to support it
under the heading of philosophical maxims i have collected all
the passages which can give us a clear comprehension of leonardos
ideas of the world at large it is scarcely necessary to observe
that there is absolutely nothing in them to lead to the inference
that he was an atheist his views of nature and its laws are no
doubt very unlike those of his contemporaries and have a much
closer affinity to those which find general acceptance at the
present day on the other hand it is obvious from leonardos will
see no 1566 that in the year before his death he had
professed to adhere to the fundamental doctrines of the roman
catholic faith and this evidently from his own personal desire and
impulse
the incredible and demonstrably fictitious legend of leonardos
death in the arms of francis the first is given with others by
vasari and further embellished by this odious comment mostrava
tuttavia quanto avea offeso dio e gli uomini del mondo non avendo
operato nellarte come si conveniva this last accusation it may
be remarked is above all evidence of the superficial character of
the information which vasari was in a position to give about
leonardo it seems to imply that leonardo was disdainful of diligent
labour with regard to the second referring to leonardos morality
and dealings with his fellow men vasari himself nullifies it by
asserting the very contrary in several passages a further
refutation may be found in the following sentence from the letter in
which melsi the young milanese nobleman announces the masters
death to leonardos brothers credo siate certificati della morte
di maestro lionardo fratello vostro e mio quanto optimo padre per
la cui morte sarebbe impossibile che io potesse esprimere il dolore
che io ho preso e in mentre che queste mia membra si sosterranno
insieme io possedero una perpetua infelicita e meritamente perche
sviscerato et ardentissimo amore mi portava giornalmente e dolto ad
ognuno la perdita di tal uomo quale non e piu in podesta della
natura ecc
it is true that in april 1476 we find the names of leonardo and
verrocchio entered in the libro degli uffiziali di notte e de
monasteri as breaking the laws but we immediately after find the
note absoluti cum condizione ut retamburentur tamburini was the
name given to the warrant cases of the night police the acquittal
therefore did not exclude the possibility of a repetition of the
charge it was in fact repeated two months later and on this
occasion the master and his pupil were again fully acquitted
verrocchio was at this time forty and leonardo fourandtwenty the
documents referring to this affair are in the state archives of
florence they have been withheld from publication but it seemed to
me desirable to give the reader this brief account of the leading
facts of the story as the vague hints of it which have recently
been made public may have given to the incident an aspect which it
had not in reality and which it does not deserve
the passages here classed under the head morals reveal leonardo
to us as a man whose life and conduct were unfailingly governed by
lofty principles and aims he could scarcely have recorded his stern
reprobation and unmeasured contempt for men who do nothing useful
and strive only for riches if his own life and ambitions had been
such as they have so often been misrepresented
at a period like that when superstition still exercised unlimited
dominion over the minds not merely of the illiterate crowd but of
the cultivated and learned classes it was very natural that
leonardos views as to alchemy ghosts magicians and the like
should be met with stern reprobation whenever and wherever he may
have expressed them this accounts for the argumentative tone of all
his utterances on such subjects which i have collected in
subdivision iii of this section to these i have added some passages
which throw light on leonardos personal views on the universe they
are without exception characterised by a broad spirit of
naturalism of which the principles are more strictly applied in his
essays on astronomy and still more on physical geography
to avoid repetition only such notes on philosophy morals and
polemics have been included in this section as occur as independent
texts in the original mss several moral reflections have already
been given in vol i in section allegorical representations
mottoes and emblems others will be found in the following section
nos 9 to 12 vol i are also passages of an argumentative
character it did not seem requisite to repeat here these and
similar passages since their direct connection with the context is
far closer in places where they have appeared already than it would
be here

o mathematicians shed light on this error
the spirit has no voice because where there is a voice there is a
body and where there is a body space is occupied and this prevents
the eye from seeing what is placed behind that space hence the
surrounding air is filled by the body that is by its image
1212
there can be no voice where there is no motion or percussion of the
air there can be no percussion of the air where there is no
instrument there can be no instrument without a body and this
being so a spirit can have neither voice nor form nor strength
and if it were to assume a body it could not penetrate nor enter
where the passages are closed and if any one should say that by
air compressed and compacted together a spirit may take bodies of
various forms and by this means speak and move with strengthto him
i reply that when there are neither nerves nor bones there can be no
force exercised in any kind of movement made by such imaginary
spirits
beware of the teaching of these speculators because their reasoning
is not confirmed by experience
1213
of all human opinions that is to be reputed the most foolish which
deals with the belief in necromancy the sister of alchemy which
gives birth to simple and natural things but it is all the more
worthy of reprehension than alchemy because it brings forth nothing
but what is like itself that is lies this does not happen in
alchemy which deals with simple products of nature and whose
function cannot be exercised by nature itself because it has no
organic instruments with which it can work as men do by means of
their hands who have produced for instance glass c but this
necromancy the flag and flying banner blown by the winds is the
guide of the stupid crowd which is constantly witness to the
dazzling and endless effects of this art and there are books full
declaring that enchantments and spirits can work and speak without
tongues and without organic instruments without which it is
impossible to speak and can carry heaviest weights and raise
storms and rain and that men can be turned into cats and wolves and
other beasts although indeed it is those who affirm these things
who first became beasts
and surely if this necromancy did exist as is believed by small
wits there is nothing on the earth that would be of so much
importance alike for the detriment and service of men if it were
true that there were in such an art a power to disturb the calm
serenity of the air converting it into darkness and making
coruscations or winds with terrific thunder and lightnings rushing
through the darkness and with violent storms overthrowing high
buildings and rooting up forests and thus to oppose armies
crushing and annihilating them and besides these frightful storms
may deprive the peasants of the reward of their laboursnow what
kind of warfare is there to hurt the enemy so much as to deprive him
of the harvest what naval warfare could be compared with this i
say the man who has power to command the winds and to make ruinous
gales by which any fleet may be submerged surely a man who could
command such violent forces would be lord of the nations and no
human ingenuity could resist his crushing force the hidden
treasures and gems reposing in the body of the earth would all be
made manifest to him no lock nor fortress though impregnable
would be able to save any one against the will of the necromancer
he would have himself carried through the air from east to west and
through all the opposite sides of the universe but why should i
enlarge further upon this what is there that could not be done by
such a craftsman almost nothing except to escape death hereby i
have explained in part the mischief and the usefulness contained in
this art if it is real and if it is real why has it not remained
among men who desire it so much having nothing to do with any
deity for i know that there are numberless people who would to
satisfy a whim destroy god and all the universe and if this
necromancy being as it were so necessary to men has not been
left among them it can never have existed nor will it ever exist
according to the definition of the spirit which is invisible in
substance for within the elements there are no incorporate things
because where there is no body there is a vacuum and no vacuum can
exist in the elements because it would be immediately filled up
turn over
1214
of spirits
we have said on the other side of this page that the definition of
a spirit is a power conjoined to a body because it cannot move of
its own accord nor can it have any kind of motion in space and if
you were to say that it moves itself this cannot be within the
elements for if the spirit is an incorporeal quantity this
quantity is called a vacuum and a vacuum does not exist in nature
and granting that one were formed it would be immediately filled up
by the rushing in of the element in which the vacuum had been
generated therefore from the definition of weight which is
thisgravity is an accidental power created by one element being
drawn to or suspended in anotherit follows that an element not
weighing anything compared with itself has weight in the element
above it and lighter than it as we see that the parts of water have
no gravity or levity compared with other water but if you draw it
up into the air then it would acquire weight and if you were to
draw the air beneath the water then the water which remains above
this air would acquire weight which weight could not sustain itself
by itself whence collapse is inevitable and this happens in water
wherever the vacuum may be in this water it will fall in and this
would happen with a spirit amid the elements where it would
continuously generate a vacuum in whatever element it might find
itself whence it would be inevitable that it should be constantly
flying towards the sky until it had quitted these elements
as to whether a spirit has a body amid the elements
we have proved that a spirit cannot exist of itself amid the
elements without a body nor can it move of itself by voluntary
motion unless it be to rise upwards but now we will say how such a
spirit taking an aerial body would be inevitably melt into air
because if it remained united it would be separated and fall to
form a vacuum as is said above therefore it is inevitable if it
is to be able to remain suspended in the air that it should absorb
a certain quantity of air and if it were mingled with the air two
difficulties arise that is to say it must rarefy that portion of
the air with which it mingles and for this cause the rarefied air
must fly up of itself and will not remain among the air that is
heavier than itself and besides this the subtle spiritual essence
disunites itself and its nature is modified by which that nature
loses some of its first virtue added to these there is a third
difficulty and this is that such a body formed of air assumed by
the spirits is exposed to the penetrating winds which are
incessantly sundering and dispersing the united portions of the air
revolving and whirling amidst the rest of the atmosphere therefore
the spirit which is infused in this
1215
air would be dismembered or rent and broken up with the rending of
the air into which it was incorporated
as to whether the spirit having taken this body of air can move of
itself or not
it is impossible that the spirit infused into a certain quantity of
air should move this air and this is proved by the above passage
where it is said the spirit rarefies that portion of the air in
which it incorporates itself therefore this air will rise high
above the other air and there will be a motion of the air caused by
its lightness and not by a voluntary movement of the spirit and if
this air is encountered by the wind according to the 3rd of this
the air will be moved by the wind and not by the spirit incorporated
in it
as to whether the spirit can speak or not
in order to prove whether the spirit can speak or not it is
necessary in the first place to define what a voice is and how it is
generated and we will say that the voice is as it were the
movement of air in friction against a dense body or a dense body in
friction against the airwhich is the same thing and this
friction of the dense and the rare condenses the rare and causes
resistance again the rare when in swift motion and the rare in
slow motion condense each other when they come in contact and make a
noise and very great uproar and the sound or murmur made by the
rare moving through the rare with only moderate swiftness like a
great flame generating noises in the air and the tremendous uproar
made by the rare mingling with the rare and when that air which is
both swift and rare rushes into that which is itself rare and in
motion it is like the flame of fire which issues from a big gun and
striking against the air and again when a flame issues from the
cloud there is a concussion in the air as the bolt is generated
therefore we may say that the spirit cannot produce a voice without
movement of the air and air in it there is none nor can it emit
what it has not and if desires to move that air in which it is
incorporated it is necessary that the spirit should multiply
itself and that cannot multiply which has no quantity and in the
4th place it is said that no rare body can move if it has not a
stable spot whence it may take its motion much more is it so when
an element has to move within its own element which does not move
of itself excepting by uniform evaporation at the centre of the
thing evaporated as occurs in a sponge squeezed in the hand held
under water the water escapes in every direction with equal
movement through the openings between the fingers of the hand in
which it is squeezed
as to whether the spirit has an articulate voice and whether the
spirit can be heard and what hearing is and seeing the wave of
the voice passes through the air as the images of objects pass to
the eye
nonentity

every quantity is intellectually conceivable as infinitely
divisible
amid the vastness of the things among which we live the existence
of nothingness holds the first place its function extends over all
things that have no existence and its essence as regards time
lies precisely between the past and the future and has nothing in
the present this nothingness has the part equal to the whole and
the whole to the part the divisible to the indivisible and the
product of the sum is the same whether we divide or multiply and in
addition as in subtraction as is proved by arithmeticians by their
tenth figure which represents zero and its power has not extension
among the things of nature
what is called nothingness is to be found only in time and in
speech in time it stands between the past and future and has no
existence in the present and thus in speech it is one of the things
of which we say they are not or they are impossible
with regard to time nothingness lies between the past and the
future and has nothing to do with the present and as to its nature
it is to be classed among things impossible hence from what has
been said it has no existence because where there is nothing there
would necessarily be a vacuum

more ready and more swift in her creating than time in his
destruction and so she has ordained that many animals shall be food
for others nay this not satisfying her desire to the same end she
frequently sends forth certain poisonous and pestilential vapours
upon the vast increase and congregation of animals and most of all
upon men who increase vastly because other animals do not feed upon
them and the causes being removed the effects would not follow

humorous writings
just as michaelangelos occasional poems reflect his private life
as well as the general disposition of his mind we may find in the
writings collected in this section the transcript of leonardos
fanciful nature and we should probably not be far wrong in
assuming that he himself had recited these fables in the company of
his friends or at the court festivals of princes and patrons era
tanto piacevole nella conversazione so relates vasariche
tirava a se gli animi delle genti and paulus jovius says in his
short biography of the artist fuit ingenio valde comi nitido
liberali vultu autem longe venustissimo et cum elegantiae omnis
deliciarumque maxime theatralium mirificus inventor ac arbiter
esset ad lyramque scito caneret cunctis per omnem aetatem
principibus mire placuit there can be no doubt that the fables are
the original offspring of leonardos brain and not borrowed from
any foreign source indeed the schemes and plans for the composition
of fables collected in division v seem to afford an external proof
of this if the fables themselves did not render it selfevident
several of them for instance no l279are so strikingly
characteristic of leonardos views of natural science that we cannot
do them justice till we are acquainted with his theories on such
subjects and this is equally true of the prophecies
i have prefixed to these quaint writings the studies on the life
and habits of animals which are singular from their peculiar
aphoristic style and i have transcribed them in exactly the order
in which they are written in ms h this is one of the very rare
instances in which one subject is treated in a consecutive series of
notes all in one ms and leonardo has also departed from his
ordinary habits by occasionally not completing the text on the page
it is begun these brief notes of a somewhat mysterious bearing have
been placed here simply because they may possibly have been
intended to serve as hints for fables or allegories they can
scarcely be regarded as preparatory for a natural history rather
they would seem to be extracts on the one hand the names of some of
the animals seem to prove that leonardo could not here be recording
observations of his own on the other hand the notes on their habits
and life appear to me to dwell precisely on what must have
interested him mostso far as it is possible to form any complete
estimate of his nature and tastes
in no 1293 lines 110 we have a sketch of a scheme for
grouping the prophecies i have not however availed myself of it as
a clue to their arrangement here because in the first place the
texts are not so numerous as to render the suggested classification
useful to the reader and also because in reading the long series
as they occur in the original we may follow the authors mind and
here and there it is not difficult to see how one theme suggested
another i have however regarded leonardos scheme for the
classification of the prophecies as available for that of the fables
and jests and have adhered to it as far as possible
among the humourous writings i might perhaps have included the
rebusses of which there are several in the collection of
leonardos drawings at windsor it seems to me not likely that many
or all of them could be solved at the present day and the mss throw
no light on them nor should i be justified if i intended to include
in the literary works the wellknown caricatures of human faces
attributed to leonardo of which however it may be incidentally
observed the greater number are in my opinion undoubtedly spurious
two only have necessarily been given owing to their presence in
text which it was desired to reproduce vol i page 326 and pl
cxxii it can scarcely be doubted that some satirical intention is
conveyed by the drawing on pl lxiv text no 688
my reason for not presenting leonardo to the reader as a poet is the
fact that the maxims and morals in verse which have been ascribed to
him are not to be found in the manuscripts and prof uzielli has
already proved that they cannot be by him hence it would seem that
only a few short verses can be attributed to him with any
certainty

the love of virtue
the goldfinch is a bird of which it is related that when it is
carried into the presence of a sick person if the sick man is going
to die the bird turns away its head and never looks at him but if
the sick man is to be saved the bird never loses sight of him but is
the cause of curing him of all his sickness
like unto this is the love of virtue it never looks at any vile or
base thing but rather clings always to pure and virtuous things and
takes up its abode in a noble heart as the birds do in green woods
on flowery branches and this love shows itself more in adversity
than in prosperity as light does which shines most where the place

thing and crows with varied and lively movements
sadness
sadness resembles the raven which when it sees its young ones born
white departs in great grief and abandons them with doleful
lamentations and does not feed them until it sees in them some few
black feathers
1222
peace
we read of the beaver that when it is pursued knowing that it is
for the virtue contained in its medicinal testicles and not being
able to escape it stops and to be at peace with its pursuers it
bites off its testicles with its sharp teeth and leaves them to its
enemies
rage
it is said of the bear that when it goes to the haunts of bees to
take their honey the bees having begun to sting him he leaves the
honey and rushes to revenge himself and as he seeks to be revenged
on all those that sting him he is revenged on none in such wise
that his rage is turned to madness and he flings himself on the
ground vainly exasperating by his hands and feet the foes against
which he is defending himself
1223
gratitude
the virtue of gratitude is said to be more developed in the birds
called hoopoes which knowing the benefits of life and food they
have received from their father and their mother when they see them
grow old make a nest for them and brood over them and feed them
and with their beaks pull out their old and shabby feathers and
then with a certain herb restore their sight so that they return to
a prosperous state
avarice
the toad feeds on earth and always remains lean because it never
eats enough it is so afraid lest it should want for earth
1224
ingratitude
pigeons are a symbol of ingratitude for when they are old enough no
longer to need to be fed they begin to fight with their father and
this struggle does not end until the young one drives the father out
and takes the hen and makes her his own
cruelty
the basilisk is so utterly cruel that when it cannot kill animals by
its baleful gaze it turns upon herbs and plants and fixing its
gaze on them withers them up
1225
generosity
it is said of the eagle that it is never so hungry but that it will
leave a part of its prey for the birds that are round it which
being unable to provide their own food are necessarily dependent on
the eagle since it is thus that they obtain food
discipline
when the wolf goes cunningly round some stable of cattle and by
accident puts his foot in a trap so that he makes a noise he bites
his foot off to punish himself for his folly
1226
flatterers or syrens
the syren sings so sweetly that she lulls the mariners to sleep
then she climbs upon the ships and kills the sleeping mariners
prudence
the ant by her natural foresight provides in the summer for the
winter killing the seeds she harvests that they may not germinate
and on them in due time she feeds
folly
the wild bull having a horror of a red colour the hunters dress up
the trunk of a tree with red and the bull runs at this with great
frenzy thus fixing his horns and forthwith the hunters kill him
there
1227
justice
we may liken the virtue of justice to the king of the bees which
orders and arranges every thing with judgment for some bees are
ordered to go to the flowers others are ordered to labour others
to fight with the wasps others to clear away all dirt others to
accompagny and escort the king and when he is old and has no wings
they carry him and if one of them fails in his duty he is punished
without reprieve
truth
although partridges steal each others eggs nevertheless the young
born of these eggs always return to their true mother
1228
fidelity or loyalty
the cranes are so faithful and loyal to their king that at night
when he is sleeping some of them go round the field to keep watch
at a distance others remain near each holding a stone in his foot
so that if sleep should overcome them this stone would fall and
make so much noise that they would wake up again and there are
others which sleep together round the king and this they do every
night changing in turn so that their king may never find them
wanting
falsehood
the fox when it sees a flock of herons or magpies or birds of that
kind suddenly flings himself on the ground with his mouth open to
look as he were dead and these birds want to peck at his tongue
and he bites off their heads
1229
lies
the mole has very small eyes and it always lives under ground and
it lives as long as it is in the dark but when it comes into the
light it dies immediately because it becomes knownand so it is
with lies
valour
the lion is never afraid but rather fights with a bold spirit and
savage onslaught against a multitude of hunters always seeking to
injure the first that injures him
fear or cowardice
the hare is always frightened and the leaves that fall from the
trees in autumn always keep him in terror and generally put him to
flight
1230
magnanimity
the falcon never preys but on large birds and it will let itself
die rather than feed on little ones or eat stinking meat
vain glory
as regards this vice we read that the peacock is more guilty of it
than any other animal for it is always contemplating the beauty of
its tail which it spreads in the form of a wheel and by its cries
attracts to itself the gaze of the creatures that surround it
and this is the last vice to be conquered
1231
constancy
constancy may be symbolised by the phoenix which knowing that by
nature it must be resuscitated has the constancy to endure the
burning flames which consume it and then it rises anew
inconstancy
the swallow may serve for inconstancy for it is always in movement
since it cannot endure the smallest discomfort
continence
the camel is the most lustful animal there is and will follow the
female for a thousand miles but if you keep it constantly with its
mother or sister it will leave them alone so temperate is its
nature
1232
incontinence
the unicorn through its intemperance and not knowing how to control
itself for the love it bears to fair maidens forgets its ferocity
and wildness and laying aside all fear it will go up to a seated
damsel and go to sleep in her lap and thus the hunters take it
humility
we see the most striking example of humility in the lamb which will
submit to any animal and when they are given for food to imprisoned
lions they are as gentle to them as to their own mother so that
very often it has been seen that the lions forbear to kill them
1233
pride
the falcon by reason of its haughtiness and pride is fain to lord
it and rule over all the other birds of prey and longs to be sole
and supreme and very often the falcon has been seen to assault the
eagle the queen of birds
abstinence
the wild ass when it goes to the well to drink and finds the water
troubled is never so thirsty but that it will abstain from
drinking and wait till the water is clear again
gluttony
the vulture is so addicted to gluttony that it will go a thousand
miles to eat a carrion carcase therefore is it that it follows
armies
1234
chastity
the turtledove is never false to its mate and if one dies the
other preserves perpetual chastity and never again sits on a green
bough nor ever again drinks of clear water
unchastity
the bat owing to unbridled lust observes no universal rule in
pairing but males with males and females with females pair
promiscuously as it may happen
moderation
the ermine out of moderation never eats but once in the day it will
rather let itself be taken by the hunters than take refuge in a
dirty lair in order not to stain its purity
1235
the eagle
the eagle when it is old flies so high that it scorches its
feathers and nature allowing that it should renew its youth it
falls into shallow water footnote 5 the meaning is obscure and
if its young ones cannot bear to gaze on the sun footnote 6 the
meaning is obscure it does not feed them with any bird that
does not wish to die animals which much fear it do not approach its
nest although it does not hurt them it always leaves part of its
prey uneaten
lumerpafame
this is found in asia major and shines so brightly that it absorbs
its own shadow and when it dies it does not lose this light and
its feathers never fall out but a feather pulled out shines no
longer
1236
the pelican
this bird has a great love for its young and when it finds them in
its nest dead from a serpents bite it pierces itself to the heart
and with its blood it bathes them till they return to life
the salamander
this has no digestive organs and gets no food but from the fire in
which it constantly renews its scaly skin
the salamander which renews its scaly skin in the firefor
virtue
the cameleon
this lives on air and there it is the prey of all the birds so in
order to be safer it flies above the clouds and finds an air so
rarefied that it cannot support the bird that follows it
at that height nothing can go unless it has a gift from heaven and
that is where the chameleon flies
1237
the alepo a fish
the fish alepo does not live out of water
the ostrich
this bird converts iron into nourishment and hatches its eggs by
its gazearmies under commanders
the swan
the swan is white without any spot and it sings sweetly as it dies
its life ending with that song
the stork
this bird by drinking saltwater purges itself of distempers if the
male finds his mate unfaithful he abandons her and when it grows
old its young ones brood over it and feed it till it dies
h1 14a
1238
the grasshopper
this silences the cuckoo with its song it dies in oil and revives
in vinegar it sings in the greatest heats
the bat
the more light there is the blinder this creature becomes as those
who gaze most at the sun become most dazzledfor vice that cannot
remain where virtue appears
the partridge
this bird changes from the female into the male and forgets its
former sex and out of envy it steals the eggs from others and
hatches them but the young ones follow the true mother
the swallow
this bird gives sight to its blind young ones by means of celandine
h1 14b
1239
the oysterfor treachery
this creature when the moon is full opens itself wide and when the
crab looks in he throws in a piece of rock or seaweed and the oyster
cannot close again whereby it serves for food to that crab this is
what happens to him who opens his mouth to tell his secret he
becomes the prey of the treacherous hearer
the basiliskcruelty
all snakes flie from this creature but the weasel attacks it by
means of rue and kills it
the asp
this carries instantaneous death in its fangs and that it may not
hear the charmer it stops its ears with its tail
1240
the dragon
this creature entangles itself in the legs of the elephant which
falls upon it and so both die and in its death it is avenged
the viper
she in pairing opens her mouth and at last clenches her teeth and
kills her husband then the young ones growing within her body rend
her open and kill their mother
the scorpion
saliva spit out when fasting will kill a scorpion this may be
likened to abstinence from greediness which removes and heals the
ills which result from that gluttony and opens the path of virtue
1241
the crocodile hypocrisy
this animal catches a man and straightway kills him after he is
dead it weeps for him with a lamentable voice and many tears then
having done lamenting it cruelly devours him it is thus with the
hypocrite who for the smallest matter has his face bathed with
tears but shows the heart of a tiger and rejoices in his heart at
the woes of others while wearing a pitiful face
the toad
the toad flies from the light of the sun and if it is held there by
force it puffs itself out so much as to hide its head below and
shield itself from the rays thus does the foe of clear and radiant
virtue who can only be constrainedly brought to face it with puffed
up courage
1242
the caterpillarfor virtue in general
the caterpillar which by means of assiduous care is able to weave
round itself a new dwelling place with marvellous artifice and fine
workmanship comes out of it afterwards with painted and lovely
wings with which it rises towards heaven
the spider
the spider brings forth out of herself the delicate and ingenious
web which makes her a return by the prey it takes
footnote two notes are underneath this text the first nessuna
chosa e da ttemere piu che lla sozza fama is a repetition of the
first line of the text given in vol i no 695
the second faticha fugga cholla fama in braccio quasi ochultata c
is written in red chalk and is evidently an incomplete sentence
1243
the lion
this animal with his thundering roar rouses his young the third
day after they are born teaching them the use of all their dormant
senses and all the wild things which are in the wood flee away
this may be compared to the children of virtue who are roused by the
sound of praise and grow up in honourable studies by which they are
more and more elevated while all that is base flies at the sound
shunning those who are virtuous
again the lion covers over its foot tracks so that the way it has
gone may not be known to its enemies thus it beseems a captain to
conceal the secrets of his mind so that the enemy may not know his
purpose
1244
the tarantula
the bite of the tarantula fixes a mans mind on one idea that is on
the thing he was thinking of when he was bitten
the screechowl and the owl
these punish those who are scoffing at them by pecking out their
eyes for nature has so ordered it that they may thus be fed
1245
the elephant
the huge elephant has by nature what is rarely found in man that is
honesty prudence justice and the observance of religion inasmuch
as when the moon is new these beasts go down to the rivers and
there solemnly cleansing themselves they bathe and so having
saluted the planet return to the woods and when they are ill
being laid down they fling up plants towards heaven as though they
would offer sacrifice they bury their tusks when they fall out
from old ageof these two tusks they use one to dig up roots for
food but they save the point of the other for fighting with when
they are taken by hunters and when worn out by fatigue they dig up
these buried tusks and ransom themselves
1246
they are merciful and know the dangers and if one finds a man
alone and lost he kindly puts him back in the road he has missed
if he finds the footprints of the man before the man himself it
dreads betrayal so it stops and blows pointing it out to the other
elephants who form in a troop and go warily
these beasts always go in troops and the oldest goes in front and
the second in age remains the last and thus they enclose the troop
out of shame they pair only at night and secretly nor do they then
rejoin the herd but first bathe in the river the females do not
fight as with other animals and it is so merciful that it is most
unwilling by nature ever to hurt those weaker than itself and if it
meets in the middle of its way a flock of sheep
1247
it puts them aside with its trunk so as not to trample them under
foot and it never hurts any thing unless when provoked when one
has fallen into a pit the others fill up the pit with branches
earth and stones thus raising the bottom that he may easily get
out they greatly dread the noise of swine and fly in confusion
doing no less harm then with their feet to their own kind than to
the enemy they delight in rivers and are always wandering about
near them though on account of their great weight they cannot swim
they devour stones and the trunks of trees are their favourite
food they have a horror of rats flies delight in their smell and
settle on their back and the beast scrapes its skin making its
folds even and kills them
1248
when they cross rivers they send their young ones up against the
stream of the water thus being set towards the fall they break
the united current of the water so that the current does not carry
them away the dragon flings itself under the elephants body and
with its tail it ties its legs with its wings and with its arms it
also clings round its ribs and cuts its throat with its teeth and
the elephant falls upon it and the dragon is burst thus in its
death it is revenged on its foe
the dragon
these go in companies together and they twine themselves after the
manner of roots and with their heads raised they cross lakes and
swim to where they find better pasture and if they did not thus
combine
1249
they would be drowned therefore they combine
the serpent
the serpent is a very large animal when it sees a bird in the air
it draws in its breath so strongly that it draws the birds into its
mouth too marcus regulus the consul of the roman army was
attacked with his army by such an animal and almost defeated and
this animal being killed by a catapult measured 123 feet that is
64 12 braccia and its head was high above all the trees in a wood
the boa
this is a very large snake which entangles itself round the legs of
the cow so that it cannot move and then sucks it in such wise that
it almost dries it up in the time of claudius the emperor there
was killed on the vatican hill
1250
one which had inside it a boy entire that it had swallowed
the maclicaught when asleep
this beast is born in scandinavia it has the shape of a great
horse excepting that the great length of its neck and of its ears
make a difference it feeds on grass going backwards for it has so
long an upper lip that if it went forwards it would cover up the
grass its legs are all in one piece for this reason when it wants
to sleep it leans against a tree and the hunters spying out the
place where it is wont to sleep saw the tree almost through and
then when it leans against it to sleep in its sleep it falls and
thus the hunters take it and every other mode of taking it is in
vain because it is incredibly swift in running
1251
the bison which does injury in its flight
this beast is a native of paeonia and has a neck with a mane like a
horse in all its other parts it is like a bull excepting that its
horns are in a way bent inwards so that it cannot butt hence it has
no safety but in flight in which it flings out its excrement to a
distance of 400 braccia in its course and this burns like fire
wherever it touches
lions pards panthers tigers
these keep their claws in the sheath and never put them out unless
they are on the back of their prey or their enemy
the lioness
when the lioness defends her young from the hand of the hunter in
order not to be frightened by the spears she keeps her eyes on the
ground to the end that she may not by her flight leave her young
ones prisoners
1252
the lion
this animal which is so terrible fears nothing more than the noise
of empty carts and likewise the crowing of cocks and it is much
terrified at the sight of one and looks at its comb with a
frightened aspect and is strangely alarmed when its face is
covered
the panther in africa
this has the form of the lioness but it is taller on its legs and
slimmer and long bodied and it is all white and marked with black
spots after the manner of rosettes and all animals delight to look
upon these rosettes and they would always be standing round it if
it were not for the terror of its face
1253
therefore knowing this it hides its face and the surrounding
animals grow bold and come close the better to enjoy the sight of
so much beauty when suddenly it seizes the nearest and at once
devours it
camels
the bactrian have two humps the arabian one only they are swift in
battle and most useful to carry burdens this animal is extremely
observant of rule and measure for it will not move if it has a
greater weight than it is used to and if it is taken too far it
does the same and suddenly stops and so the merchants are obliged
to lodge there
1254
the tiger
this beast is a native of hyrcania and it is something like the
panther from the various spots on its skin it is an animal of
terrible swiftness the hunter when he finds its young ones carries
them off hastily placing mirrors in the place whence he takes them
and at once escapes on a swift horse the panther returning finds
the mirrors fixed on the ground and looking into them believes it
sees its young then scratching with its paws it discovers the
cheat forthwith by means of the scent of its young it follows the
hunter and when this hunter sees the tigress he drops one of the
young ones and she takes it and having carried it to the den she
immediately returns to the hunter and does
1255
the same till he gets into his boat
catoblepas
it is found in ethiopia near to the source nigricapo it is not a
very large animal is sluggish in all its parts and its head is so
large that it carries it with difficulty in such wise that it
always droops towards the ground otherwise it would be a great pest
to man for any one on whom it fixes its eyes dies immediately
footnote leonardo undoubtedly derived these remarks as to the
catoblepas from pliny hist nat viii 21 al 32 apud hesperios
aethiopas fons est nigris different readings ut plerique
existimavere nili caputjuxta hunc fera appellatur catoblepas
modica alioquin ceterisque membris iners caput tantum praegrave
aegre ferens alias internecio humani generis omnibus qui oculos
ejus videre confestim morientibus aelian hist an gives a far
more minute description of the creature but he says that it poisons
beasts not by its gaze but by its venomous breath athenaeus 221 b
mentions both if leonardo had known of these two passages he would
scarcely have omitted the poisonous breath h mullerstrubing
the basilisk
this is found in the province of cyrenaica and is not more than 12
fingers long it has on its head a white spot after the fashion of a
diadem it scares all serpents with its whistling it resembles a
snake but does not move by wriggling but from the centre forwards
to the right it is said that one
1256
of these being killed with a spear by one who was on horseback
and its venom flowing on the spear not only the man but the horse
also died it spoils the wheat and not only that which it touches
but where it breathes the grass dries and the stones are split
the weasel
this beast finding the lair of the basilisk kills it with the smell
of its urine and this smell indeed often kills the weasel itself
the cerastes
this has four movable little horns so when it wants to feed it
hides under leaves all of its body except these little horns which
as they move seem to the birds to be some small worms at play then
they immediately swoop down to pick them and the cerastes suddenly
twines round them and encircles and devours them
1257
the amphisboena
this has two heads one in its proper place the other at the tail
as if one place were not enough from which to fling its venom
the iaculus
this lies on trees and flings itself down like a dart and pierces
through the wild beast and kills them
the asp
the bite of this animal cannot be cured unless by immediately
cutting out the bitten part this pestilential animal has such a
love for its mate that they always go in company and if by mishap
one of them is killed the other with incredible swiftness follows
him who has killed it and it is so determined and eager for
vengeance that it overcomes every difficulty and passing by every
troop it seeks to hurt none but its enemy and it will travel any
distance and it is impossible to avoid it unless by crossing water
and by very swift flight it has its eyes turned inwards and large
ears and it hears better than it sees
1258
the ichneumon
this animal is the mortal enemy of the asp it is a native of egypt
and when it sees an asp near its place it runs at once to the bed
or mud of the nile and with this makes itself muddy all over then
it dries itself in the sun smears itself again with mud and thus
drying one after the other it makes itself three or four coatings
like a coat of mail then it attacks the asp and fights well with
him so that taking its time it catches him in the throat and
destroys him
the crocodile
this is found in the nile it has four feet and lives on land and in
water no other terrestrial creature but this is found to have no
tongue and it only bites by moving its upper jaw it grows to a
length of forty feet and has claws and is armed with a hide that
will take any blow by day it is on land and at night in the water
it feeds on fishes and going to sleep on the bank of the nile with
its mouth open a bird called
1259
trochilus a very small bird runs at once to its mouth and hops
among its teeth and goes pecking out the remains of the food and so
inciting it with voluptuous delight tempts it to open the whole of
its mouth and so it sleeps this being observed by the ichneumon it
flings itself into its mouth and perforates its stomach and bowels
and finally kills it
the dolphin
nature has given such knowledge to animals that besides the
consciousness of their own advantages they know the disadvantages of
their foes thus the dolphin understands what strength lies in a cut
from the fins placed on his chine and how tender is the belly of
the crocodile hence in fighting with him it thrusts at him from
beneath and rips up his belly and so kills him
the crocodile is a terror to those that flee and a base coward to
those that pursue him
1260
the hippopotamus
this beast when it feels itself overfull goes about seeking thorns
or where there may be the remains of canes that have been split and
it rubs against them till a vein is opened then when the blood has
flowed as much as he needs he plasters himself with mud and heals
the wound in form he is something like a horse with long haunches
a twisted tail and the teeth of a wild boar his neck has a mane
the skin cannot be pierced unless when he is bathing he feeds on
plants in the fields and goes into them backwards so that it may
seem as though he had come out
the ibis
this bird resembles a crane and when it feels itself ill it fills
its craw with water and with its beak makes an injection of it
the stag
these creatures when they feel themselves bitten by the spider
called fatherlonglegs eat crabs and free themselves of the venom

this beast after its bowels have fallen out will still fight with
the dogs and hunters
1262
the chameleon
this creature always takes the colour of the thing on which it is
resting whence it is often devoured together with the leaves on
which the elephant feeds
the raven
when it has killed the chameleon it takes laurel as a purge
1263
moderation checks all the vices the ermine will die rather than
besmirch itself
of foresight
the cock does not crow till it has thrice flapped its wings the
parrot in moving among boughs never puts its feet excepting where it
has first put its beak vows are not made till hope is dead
motion tends towards the centre of gravity
1264
magnanimity

perceiving the odour of the greasy wool judged that this must be a
land of better living and also more secure from the teeth and nails
of the dog than where he fed on the dog and without farther
reflection he left the dog and went into the thick wool there he
began with great labour to try to pass among the roots of the hairs
but after much sweating had to give up the task as vain because
these hairs were so close that they almost touched each other and
there was no space where fleas could taste the skin hence after
much labour and fatigue he began to wish to return to his dog who
however had already departed so he was constrained after long
repentance and bitter tears to die of hunger

at its ease through the air overcome by the tempting flame of the

the foot of the candlestick after much lamentation and repentance

resorted to by bees and divers kinds of flies it seemed to her that
she had found a most convenient spot to spread her snare and having
settled herself on it with her delicate web and entered into her
new habitation there every day placing herself in the openings
made by the spaces between the grapes she fell like a thief on the
wretched creatures which were not aware of her but after a few
days had passed the vintager came and cut away the bunch of grapes
and put it with others with which it was trodden and thus the
grapes were a snare and pitfall both for the treacherous spider and

the water finding that its element was the lordly ocean was seized
with a desire to rise above the air and being encouraged by the
element of fire and rising as a very subtle vapour it seemed as
though it were really as thin as air but having risen very high it
reached the air that was still more rare and cold where the fire
forsook it and the minute particles being brought together united
and became heavy whence its haughtiness deserting it it betook

a fable
the razor having one day come forth from the handle which serves as
its sheath and having placed himself in the sun saw the sun
reflected in his body which filled him with great pride and
turning it over in his thoughts he began to say to himself and
shall i return again to that shop from which i have just come
certainly not such splendid beauty shall not please god be turned
to such base uses what folly it would be that could lead me to
shave the lathered beards of rustic peasants and perform such menial
service is this body destined for such work certainly not i will
hide myself in some retired spot and there pass my life in tranquil
repose and having thus remained hidden for some months one day he
came out into the air and issuing from his sheath saw himself
turned to the similitude of a rusty saw while his surface no longer
reflected the resplendent sun with useless repentance he vainly
deplored the irreparable mischief saying to himself oh how far
better was it to employ at the barbers my lost edge of such
exquisite keenness where is that lustrous surface it has been
consumed by this vexatious and unsightly rust
the same thing happens to those minds which instead of exercise give
themselves up to sloth they are like the razor here spoken of and
lose the keenness of their edge while the rust of ignorance spoils
their form
a fable
a stone of some size recently uncovered by the water lay on a
certain spot somewhat raised and just where a delightful grove
ended by a stony road here it was surrounded by plants decorated by
various flowers of divers colours and as it saw the great quantity
of stones collected together in the roadway below it began to wish
it could let itself fall down there saying to itself what have i
to do here with these plants i want to live in the company of
those my sisters and letting itself fall its rapid course ended
among these longed for companions when it had been there sometime
it began to find itself constantly toiling under the wheels of the
carts the ironshoed feet of horses and of travellers this one
rolled it over that one trod upon it sometimes it lifted itself a
little and then it was covered with mud or the dung of some animal
and it was in vain that it looked at the spot whence it had come as
a place of solitude and tranquil place
thus it happens to those who choose to leave a life of solitary
comtemplation and come to live in cities among people full of
infinite evil

some flames had already lasted in the furnace of a glassblower
when they saw a candle approaching in a beautiful and glittering
candlestick with ardent longing they strove to reach it and one of
them quitting its natural course writhed up to an unburnt brand on
which it fed and passed at the opposite end out by a narrow chink to
the candle which was near it flung itself upon it and with fierce
jealousy and greediness it devoured it having reduced it almost to
death and wishing to procure the prolongation of its life it
tried to return to the furnace whence it had come but in vain for
it was compelled to die the wood perishing together with the
candle being at last converted with lamentation and repentance
into foul smoke while leaving all its sisters in brilliant and
enduring life and beauty

a small patch of snow finding itself clinging to the top of a rock
which was lying on the topmost height of a very high mountain and
being left to its own imaginings it began to reflect in this way
saying to itself now shall not i be thought vain and proud for
having placed myselfsuch a small patch of snowin so lofty a
spot and for allowing that so large a quantity of snow as i have
seen here around me should take a place lower than mine certainly
my small dimensions by no means merit this elevation how easily may
i in proof of my insignificance experience the same fate as that
which the sun brought about yesterday to my companions who were
all in a few hours destroyed by the sun and this happened from
their having placed themselves higher than became them i will flee
from the wrath of the sun and humble myself and find a place
befitting my small importance thus flinging itself down it began
to descend hurrying from its high home on to the other snow but
the more it sought a low place the more its bulk increased so that
when at last its course was ended on a hill it found itself no less
in size than the hill which supported it and it was the last of the
snow which was destroyed that summer by the sun this is said for
those who humbling themselves become exalted

the cedar being desirous of producing a fine and noble fruit at its
summit set to work to form it with all the strength of its sap but
this fruit when grown was the cause of the tall and upright
treetop being bent over
the peach being envious of the vast quantity of fruit which she saw
borne on the nuttree her neighbour determined to do the same and
loaded herself with her own in such a way that the weight of the
fruit pulled her up by the roots and broke her down to the ground
the nuttree stood always by a road side displaying the wealth of
its fruit to the passers by and every one cast stones at it
the figtree having no fruit no one looked at it then wishing to
produce fruits that it might be praised by men it was bent and
broken down by them
the figtree standing by the side of the elm and seeing that its
boughs were bare of fruit yet that it had the audacity to keep the
sun from its own unripe figs with its branches said to it oh elm
art thou not ashamed to stand in front of me but wait till my
offspring are fully grown and you will see where you are but when
her offspring were mature a troop of soldiers coming by fell upon
the figtree and her figs were all torn off her and her boughs cut
away and broken then when she was thus maimed in all her limbs
the elm asked her saying o figtree which was best to be
without offspring or to be brought by them into so miserable a
plight

a fable
a nut having been carried by a crow to the top of a tall campanile
and released by falling into a chink from the mortal grip of its
beak it prayed the wall by the grace bestowed on it by god in
allowing it to be so high and thick and to own such fine bells and
of so noble a tone that it would succour it and that as it had
not been able to fall under the verdurous boughs of its venerable
father and lie in the fat earth covered up by his fallen leaves it
would not abandon it because finding itself in the beak of the
cruel crow it had there made a vow that if it escaped from her it
would end its life in a little hole at these words the wall moved
to compassion was content to shelter it in the spot where it had
fallen and after a short time the nut began to split open and put
forth roots between the rifts of the stones and push them apart and
to throw out shoots from its hollow shell and to be brief these
rose above the building and the twisted roots growing thicker
began to thrust the walls apart and tear out the ancient stones
from their old places then the wall too late and in vain bewailed
the cause of its destruction and in a short time it wrought the
ruin of a great part of it
1278
a fable
the privet feeling its tender boughs loaded with young fruit
pricked by the sharp claws and beak of the insolent blackbird
complained to the blackbird with pitious remonstrance entreating her
that since she stole its delicious fruits she should not deprive it
of the leaves with which it preserved them from the burning rays of
the sun and that she should not divest it of its tender bark by
scratching it with her sharp claws to which the blackbird replied
with angry upbraiding o be silent uncultured shrub do you not
know that nature made you produce these fruits for my nourishment
do you not see that you are in the world only to serve me as food
do you not know base creature that next winter you will be food
and prey for the fire to which words the tree listened patiently
and not without tears after a short time the blackbird was taken in
a net and boughs were cut to make a cage in which to imprison her
branches were cut among others from the pliant privet to serve for
the small rods of the cage and seeing herself to be the cause of
the blackbirds loss of liberty it rejoiced and spoke as follows o
blackbird i am here and not yet burnt by fire as you said i shall
see you in prison before you see me burnt
a fable
the laurel and the myrtle seeing the pear tree cut down cried out
with a loud voice o peartree whither are you going where is the
pride you had when you were covered with ripe fruits now you will
no longer shade us with your mass of leaves then the peartree
replied i am going with the husbandman who has cut me down and who
will take me to the workshop of a good sculptor who by his art will
make me take the form of jove the god and i shall be dedicated in a
temple and adored by men in the place of jove while you are bound
always to remain maimed and stripped of your boughs which will be
placed round me to do me honour
a fable
the chesnut seeing a man upon the figtree bending its boughs down
and pulling off the ripe fruits which he put into his open mouth
destroying and crushing them with his hard teeth it tossed its long
boughs and with a noisy rustle exclaimed o fig how much less are
you protected by nature than i see how in me my sweet offspring are
set in close array first clothed in soft wrappers over which is the
hard but softly lined husk and not content with taking this care of
me and having given them so strong a shelter on this she has
placed sharp and closeset spines so that the hand of man cannot
hurt me then the figtree and her offspring began to laugh and
having laughed she said i know man to be of such ingenuity that
with rods and stones and stakes flung up among your branches he will
bereave you of your fruits and when they are fallen he will
trample them with his feet or with stones so that your offspring
will come out of their armour crushed and maimed while i am
touched carefully by their hands and not like you with sticks and
stones

the hapless willow finding that she could not enjoy the pleasure of
seeing her slender branches grow or attain to the height she wished
or point to the sky by reason of the vine and whatever other trees
that grew near but was always maimed and lopped and spoiled
brought all her spirits together and gave and devoted itself
entirely to imagination standing plunged in long meditation and
seeking in all the world of plants with which of them she might
ally herself and which could not need the help of her withes having
stood for some time in this prolific imagination with a sudden
flash the gourd presented itself to her thoughts and tossing all her
branches with extreme delight it seemed to her that she had found
the companion suited to her purpose because the gourd is more apt
to bind others than to need binding having come to this conclusion
she awaited eagerly some friendly bird who should be the mediator of
her wishes presently seeing near her the magpie she said to him o
gentle bird by the memory of the refuge which you found this
morning among my branches when the hungry cruel and rapacious
falcon wanted to devour you and by that repose which you have
always found in me when your wings craved rest and by the pleasure
you have enjoyed among my boughs when playing with your companions
or making lovei entreat you find the gourd and obtain from her
some of her seeds and tell her that those that are born of them i
will treat exactly as though they were my own flesh and blood and
in this way use all the words you can think of which are of the
same persuasive purport though indeed since you are a master of
language i need not teach you and if you will do me this service i
shall be happy to have your nest in the fork of my boughs and all
your family without payment of any rent then the magpie having
made and confirmed certain new stipulations with the willowand
principally that she should never admit upon her any snake or
polecat cocked his tail and put down his head and flung himself
from the bough throwing his weight upon his wings and these
beating the fleeting air now here now there bearing about
inquisitively while his tail served as a rudder to steer him he
came to a gourd then with a handsome bow and a few polite words he
obtained the required seeds and carried them to the willow who
received him with a cheerful face and when he had scraped away with
his foot a small quantity of the earth near the willow describing a
circle with his beak he planted the grains which in a short time
began to grow and by their growth and the branches to take up all
the boughs of the willow while their broad leaves deprived it of
the beauty of the sun and sky and not content with so much evil
the gourds next began by their rude hold to drag the ends of the
tender shoots down towards the earth with strange twisting and
distortion
then being much annoyed it shook itself in vain to throw off the
gourd after raving for some days in such plans vainly because the
firm union forbade it seeing the wind come by it commended itself
to him the wind flew hard and opened the old and hollow stem of the
willow in two down to the roots so that it fell into two parts in
vain did it bewail itself recognising that it was born to no good
end

a jest
a priest making the rounds of his parish on easter eve and
sprinkling holy water in the houses as is customary came to a
painters room where he sprinkled the water on some of his
pictures the painter turned round somewhat angered and asked him
why this sprinkling had been bestowed on his pictures then said the
priest that it was the custom and his duty to do so and that he
was doing good and that he who did good might look for good in
return and indeed for better since god had promised that every
good deed that was done on earth should be rewarded a hundredfold
from above then the painter waiting till he went out went to an
upper window and flung a large pail of water on the priests back
saying here is the reward a hundredfold from above which you
said would come from the good you had done me with your holy water
by which you have damaged my pictures

wine the divine juice of the grape finding itself in a golden and
richly wrought cup on the table of mahomet was puffed up with
pride at so much honour when suddenly it was struck by a contrary
reflection saying to itself what am i about that i should
rejoice and not perceive that i am now near to my death and shall
leave my golden abode in this cup to enter into the foul and fetid
caverns of the human body and to be transmuted from a fragrant and
delicious liquor into a foul and base one nay and as though so
much evil as this were not enough i must for a long time lie in
hideous receptacles together with other fetid and corrupt matter
cast out from human intestines and it cried to heaven imploring
vengeance for so much insult and that an end might henceforth be
put to such contempt and that since that country produced the
finest and best grapes in the whole world at least they should not
be turned into wine then jove made that wine drunk by mahomet to
rise in spirit to his brain and that in so deleterious a manner
that it made him mad and gave birth to so many follies that when he
had recovered himself he made a law that no asiatic should drink
wine and henceforth the vine and its fruit were left free
as soon as wine has entered the stomach it begins to ferment and
swell then the spirit of that man begins to abandon his body
rising as it were skywards and the brain finds itself parting from
the body then it begins to degrade him and make him rave like a
madman and then he does irreparable evil killing his friends

an artizan often going to visit a great gentleman without any
definite purpose the gentleman asked him what he did this for the
other said that he came there to have a pleasure which his lordship
could not have since to him it was a satisfaction to see men

gentleman could only see men of less consequence than himself and
so lords and great men were deprived of that pleasure

franciscan begging friars are wont at certain times to keep fasts
when they do not eat meat in their convents but on journeys as
they live on charity they have license to eat whatever is set
before them now a couple of these friars on their travels stopped
at an inn in company with a certain merchant and sat down with him
at the same table where from the poverty of the inn nothing was
served to them but a small roast chicken the merchant seeing this
to be but little even for himself turned to the friars and said
if my memory serves me you do not eat any kind of flesh in your
convents at this season at these words the friars were compelled
by their rule to admit without cavil that this was the truth so
the merchant had his wish and eat the chicken and the friars did
the best they could after dinner the messmates departed all three
together and after travelling some distance they came to a river of
some width and depth all three being on footthe friars by reason
of their poverty and the other from avariceit was necessary by
the custom of company that one of the friars being barefoot should
carry the merchant on his shoulders so having given his wooden
shoes into his keeping he took up his man but it so happened that
when the friar had got to the middle of the river he again
remembered a rule of his order and stopping short he looked up
like saint christopher to the burden on his back and said tell
me have you any money about youyou know i have answered the
other how do you suppose that a merchant like me should go about
otherwise alack cried the friar our rules forbid as to carry
any money on our persons and forthwith he dropped him into the
water which the merchant perceived was a facetious way of being
revenged on the indignity he had done them so with a smiling face
and blushing somewhat with shame he peaceably endured the revenge

lamenting to this former friend after much complaining entreated
him to say what might be the cause that had made him forget so much
friendship to which he answered i will no longer be intimate with
you because i love you and i do not choose that you by speaking
ill of me your friend to others should produce in others as in
me a bad impression of yourself by speaking evil to them of me
your friend therefore being no longer intimate together it will
seem as though we had become enemies and in speaking evil of me as
is your wont you will not be blamed so much as if we continued
intimate

why dogs take pleasure in smelling at each other
this animal has a horror of the poor because they eat poor food
and it loves the rich because they have good living and especially
meat and the excrement of animals always retains some virtue of its
origin as is shown by the faeces 
now dogs have so keen a smell that they can discern by their nose
the virtue remaining in these faeces and if they find them in the
streets smell them and if they smell in them the virtue of meat or
of other things they take them and if not they leave them and to
return to the question i say that if by means of this smell they
know that dog to be well fed they respect him because they judge
that he has a powerful and rich master and if they discover no such
smell with the virtue of meat they judge that dog to be of small
account and to have a poor and humble master and therefore they
bite that dog as they would his master

letters personal records dated notes
when we consider how superficial and imperfect are the accounts of
leonardos life written some time after his death by vasari and
others any notes or letters which can throw more light on his
personal circumstances cannot fail to be in the highest degree
interesting the texts here given as nos 13511353 set his
residence in rome in quite a new aspect nay the picture which
irresistibly dwells in our minds after reading these details of his
life in the vatican forms a striking contrast to the contemporary
life of raphael at rome
i have placed foremost of these documents the very remarkable
letters to the defterdar of syria in these leonardo speaks of
himself as having staid among the mountains of armenia and as the
biographies of the master tell nothing of any such distant journeys
it would seem most obvious to treat this passage as fiction and so
spare ourselves the onus of proof and discussion but on close
examination no one can doubt that these documents with the
accompanying sketches are the work of leonardos own hand not
merely is the character of the handwriting his but the spelling and
the language are his also in one respect only does the writing
betray any marked deviation from the rest of the notes especially
those treating on scientific questions namely in these
observations he seems to have taken particular pains to give the
most distinct and best form of expression to all he had to say we
find erasures and emendations in almost every line he proceeded as
we shall see in the same way in the sketches for letters to
giuliano de medici and what can be more natural i may ask than
to find the draft of a letter thus altered and improved when it is
to contain an account of a definite subject and when personal
interests are in the scale the finished copies as sent off are not
known to exist if we had these instead of the rough drafts we
might unhesitatingly have declared that some unknown italian
engineer must have been at that time engaged in armenia in the
service of the egyptian sultan and that leonardo had copied his
documents under this hypothesis however we should have to state
that this unknown writer must have been so far one in mind with
leonardo as to use the same style of language and even the same
lines of thought this explanation mightas i sayhave been
possible if only we had the finished letters but why should these
rough drafts of letters be regarded as anything else than what they
actually and obviously are if leonardo had been a man of our own
time we might perhaps have attempted to account for the facts by
saying that leonardo without having been in the east himself might
have undertaken to write a romance of which the scene was laid in
armenia and at the desire of his publisher had made sketches of
landscape to illustrate the text
i feel bound to mention this singular hypothesis as it has actually
been put forward see no 1336 note 5 and it would certainly seem
as though there were no other possible way of evading the conclusion
to which these letters point and their bearing on the life of the
masterabsurd as the alternative is but if on a question of
such importance we are justified in suggesting theories that have
no foundation in probability i could suggest another which as
compared with that of a fiction by leonardo would be neither more
nor less plausible it is moreover the only other hypothesis
perhaps which can be devised to account for these passages if it
were possible to prove that the interpretation that the documents
themselves suggest must be rejected a priori viz may not leonardo
have written them with the intention of mystifying those who after
his death should try to decipher these manuscripts with a view to
publishing them but if in fact no objection that will stand the
test of criticism can be brought against the simple and direct
interpretation of the words as they stand we are bound to regard
leonardos travels in the east as an established fact there is i
believe nothing in what we know of his biography to negative such a
fact especially as the details of his life for some few years are
wholly unknown nor need we be at a loss for evidence which may
serve to explainat any rate to some extentthe strangeness of his
undertaking such a journey we have no information as to leonardos
history between 1482 and 1486 it cannot be proved that he was
either in milan or in florence on the other hand the tenor of this
letter does not require us to assume a longer absence than a year or
two for even if his appointment offitio as engineer in syria
had been a permanent one it might have become untenableby the
death perhaps of the defterdar his patron or by his removal from
office and leonardo on his return home may have kept silence on
the subject of an episode which probably had ended in failure and
disappointment
from the text of no 1379 we can hardly doubt that leonardo intended
to make an excursion secretly from rome to naples although so far
as has hitherto been known his biographers never allude to it in
another place no 1077 he says that he had worked as an engineer
in friuli are we to doubt this statement too merely because no
biographer has hitherto given us any information on the matter in
the geographical notes leonardo frequently speaks of the east and
though such passages afford no direct proof of his having been
there they show beyond a doubt that next to the nile the
euphrates the tigris and the taurus mountains had a special
interest in his eyes as a still further proof of the futility of
the argument that there is nothing in his drawings to show that he
had travelled in the east we find on pl cxx a study of oriental
heads of armenian typethough of course this may have been made in
italy
if the style of these letters were less sober and the expressions
less strictly to the point throughout it miglit be possible to
regard them as a romantic fiction instead of a narrative of fact
nay we have only to compare them with such obviously fanciful
passages as no 1354 nos 670673 and the fables and prophecies
it is unnecessary to discuss the subject any further here such
explanations as the letter needs are given in the foot notes
the drafts of letters to lodovico il moro are very remarkable
leonardo and this prince were certainly far less closely connected
than has hitherto been supposed it is impossible that leonardo can
have remained so long in the service of this prince because the
salary was good as is commonly stated on the contrary it would
seem that what kept him there in spite of his sore need of the
money owed him by the prince was the hope of some day being able to
carry out the project of casting the gran cavallo

the word however is not of turkish but of persoarabie derivation
defter written in arab literally defter arabic meaning
folio for dar persian bookkeeper or holder is the english
equivalent and the idea is that of a deputy in command during the
mamelook supremacy over syria which corresponded in date with
leonardos time the office of defterdar was the third in importance

soltano di babilonia the name of babylon was commonly applied to
cairo in the middle ages for instance breidenbach itinerarium

not that babylon which stood on the further shore of the river
chober but that which is called the egyptian babylon it is close
by cairo and the twain are but one and not two towns one half is
called cairo and the other babylon whence they are called together

memphis and then babylon but now it is called cairo compare no

egypt was governed from 1382 till 1517 by the borgite or
tcherkessian dynasty of the mamelook sultans one of the most famous
of these sultan kait bey ruled from 14681496 during whose reign
the gama or mosque of kait bey and tomb of kait bey near the
okella kait bey were erected in cairo which preserve his name to
this day under the rule of this great and wise prince many
foreigners particularly italians found occupation in egypt as may
be seen in the viaggio di josaphat barbaro among other
travellers next to leonardo so i learn from prof jac burckhardt
of bale kait beys most helpful engineer was a german who in about
1487 superintended the construction of the mole at alexandria

first the effect and then the cause footnote 4 the text here
breaks off the following lines are a fresh beginning of a letter
evidently addressed to the same person but as it would seem
written at a later date than the previous text the numerous
corrections and amendments amply prove that it is not a copy from
any account of a journey by some unknown person but on the
contrary that leonardo was particularly anxious to choose such
words and phrases as might best express his own ideas
finding myself in this part of armenia footnote 5 parti
derminia see no 945 note the extent of armenia in leonardos
time is only approximately known in the xvth century the persians
governed the eastern and the arabs the southern portions arabic
authorsas for instance abulfedainclude cilicia and a part of
cappadocia in armenia and greater armenia was the tract of that
country known later as turcomania while armenia minor was the
territory between cappadocia and the euphrates it was not till
1522 or even 1574 that the whole country came under the dominion of
the ottoman turks in the reign of selim i
the mamelook sultans of egypt seem to have taken a particular
interest in this the most northern province of their empire which
was even then in danger of being conquered by the turks in the
autumn of 1477 sultan kait bey made a journey of inspection
visiting antioch and the valleys of the tigris and euphrates with a
numerous and brilliant escort this tour is briefly alluded to by
moodshireddin p 561 and by weil geschichte der abbasiden v

without notes or commentary compare the critique on this edition
by j gildemeister in zeitschrift des deutschen palaestina vereins
vol ill p 246249 lanzones edition seems to be no more than
an abridged copy of the original i owe to professor schefer
membre de linstitut the information that he is in possession of a
manuscript in which the text is fuller and more correctly given
the mamelook dynasty was as is well known of circassian origin
and a large proportion of the egyptian army was recruited in
circassia even so late as in the xvth century that was a period of
political storms in syria and asia minor and it is easy to suppose
that the sultans minister to whom leonardo addresses his report as
his superior had a special interest in the welfare of those
frontier provinces only to mention a few historical events of
sultan kait beys reign we find that in 1488 he assisted the
circassians to resist the encroachments of alaeddoulet an asiatic
prince who had allied himself with the osmanli to threaten the
province the consequence was a war in cilicia by sea and land
which broke out in the following year between the contending powers
only a few years earlier the same province had been the scene of the
socalled caramenian war in which the united venetian neapolitan
and sclavonic fleets had been engaged see corialano cippico

indicate one of the numerous renegades of italian birthplayed an
important part in the negotiations for peace
tu mi mandasti the address tu to a personage so high in office
is singular and suggests personal intimacy leonardo seems to have
been a favourite with the diodario compare lines 54 and 55
i have endeavoured to show and i believe that i am also in a
position to prove with regard to these texts that they are draughts
of letters actually written by leonardo at the same time i must not
omit to mention that shortly after i had discovered
to carry into effect with due love and care the task for which you
sent me footnote 6 and to make a beginning in a place which
seemed to me to be most to our purpose i entered into
is the following from previous page 3 il nuovo accidente
accaduto or as leonardo first wrote and then erased e accaduto
un nuovo accidente from the sequel this must refer to an
earthquake and indeed these were frequent at that period
particularly in asia minor where they caused immense mischief see

the city of calindrafy7 near to our frontiers this city is
situated at the base of that part of the taurus mountains which is
divided from the euphrates and looks towards the peaks of the great
mount taurus 8 to the west 9 these peaks are of such a height
that they seem to touch the sky and in all the world there is no
part of the earth higher than its summit10 and the rays of
these texts in the codex atlanticus and publi shed a paper on the
subject in the zeit schrift fur bildende kunst vol xvi prof
govi put forward this hypothesis to account for their origin
quanto alle notizie sul monte tauro sullarmenia e sull asia
minore che si contengono negli altri frammenti esse vennero prese
da qualche geografro o viaggiatore contemporaneo dallindice
imperfetto che accompagna quei frammenti si potrebbe dedurre che
leonardo volesse farne un libro che poi non venne compiuto a ogni
modo non e possibile di trovare in questi brani nessun indizio di
un viaggio di leonardo in oriente ne della sua conversione alla
religione di maometto come qualcuno pretenderebbe leonardo amava
con passione gli studi geografici e nel suoi scritti sincontran
spesso itinerart indicazioni o descrizioni di luoghi schizzi di
carte e abbozzi topografici di varie regioni non e quindi strano
che egli abile narratore comera si fosse proposto di scrivere una
specie di romanzo in forma epistolare svolgendone pintreccio
nellasia minore intorno alla quale i libri dallora e forse
qualche viaggiatore amico suo gli avevano somministrato alcuni
elementi piu o meno
fantastici see transunti della reale accademia dei lincei voi v
ser 3
it is hardly necessary to point out that prof govi omits to name
the sources from which leonardo could be supposed to have drawn his
information and i may leave it to the reader to pronounce judgment
on the anomaly which is involved in the hypothesis that we have here
a fragment of a romance cast in the form of a correspondence at
the same time i cannot but admit that the solution of the
difficulties proposed by prof govi is under the circumstances
certainly the easiest way of dealing with the question but we
should then be equally justified in supposing some more of
leonardos letters to be fragments of such romances particularly
those of which the addresses can no longer be named still as
regards these drafts of letters to the diodario if we accept the
romance theory as pro posed by prof govi we are also compelled
to assume that leonardo purposed from the first to illustrate his
tale for it needs only a glance at the
sketches on pi cxvi to cxix to perceive that they are connected
with the texts and of course the rest of leonardos numerous notes
on matters pertaining to the east the greater part of which are
here published for the first time may also be some how connected
with this strange romance
7 citta de calindra chalindra the position of this city is so
exactly determined between the valley of the euphrates and the
taurus range that it ought to be possible to identify it but it can
hardly be the same as the sea port of cilicia with a somewhat
similar name celenderis kelandria celendria kilindria now the
turkish gulnar in two catalonian portulans in the bibliotheque
natio nale in parisone dating from the xvh century by wilhelm
von soler the other by olivez de majorca in l584i find this place
called calandra but leonardos calindra must certainly have lain
more to the north west probably somewhere in kurdistan the fact
that the geographical position is so care fully determined by
leonardo seems to prove that it was a place of no great importance
and little known it is singular that the words first written in 1
8 were divisa dal lago lake van altered afterwards to
dalleitfrates
nostri confini and in 1 6 proposito nostro these refer to the
frontier and to the affairs of the mamelook sultan lines 65 and 66
throw some light on the purpose of leonardos mission
8 i corni del gra mote tauro compare the sketches pi
cxvicxviii so long as it is im possible to identify the situation
of calindra it is most difficult to decide with any certainty which
peak of the taurus is here meant and i greatly regret that i had no
foreknowledge of this puzzling topographical question when in 1876
i was pursuing archaeological enquiries in the provinces of aleppo
and cilicia and had to travel for some time in view of the imposing
snowpeaks of bulghar dagh and ala tepessi
910 the opinion here expressed as to the height of the mountain
would be unmeaning unless it had been written before leonardo moved
to milan where monte rosa is so conspicuous an the sun always fall
upon it on its east side four hours before daytime and being of
the whitest stone footnote iipietra bianchissima the taurus
mountains consist in great part of limestone it shines
resplendently and fulfils the function to these armenians which a
bright moonlight would in the midst of the darkness and by its
great height it outreaches the utmost level of the clouds by a space
of four miles in a straight line this peak is seen in many places
towards the west illuminated by the sun after its setting the third
part of the night this it is which with you footnote 14
appresso di voi leonardo had at first written noi as though his
meaning hadbeen this peak appeared to us to be a comet when you
and i observed it in north syria at aleppo at aintas the
description of the curious reflection in the evening resembling the
alpineglow is certainly not an invented fiction for in the next
lines an explanation of the phenomenon is offered or at least
attempted we formerly in calm weather had supposed to be a comet
and appears to us in the darkness of night to change its form
being sometimes divided in two or three parts and sometimes long
and sometimes short and this is caused by the clouds on the horizon
of the sky which interpose between part of this mountain and the
sun and by cutting off some of the solar rays the light on the
mountain is intercepted by various intervals of clouds and
therefore varies in the form of its brightness

i am not to be accused oh devatdar of idleness as your chidings
seem to hint but your excessive love for me which gave rise to the
benefits you have conferred on me footnote 55 is that which has
also compelled me to the utmost painstaking in seeking out and
diligently investigating the cause of so great and stupendous an
effect and this could not be done without time now in order to
satisfy you fully as to the cause of so great an effect it is
requisite that i should explain to you the form of the place and
then i will proceed to the effect by which i believe you will be
amply satisfied

following statement occurs in the year 889 1484 ad there were
six shocks of earthquake at aleppo they were excessively violent
and threw the inhabitants into consternation i owe this
communication to the kindness of prof ch schefer membre de

certainly living in milan

letter lines 5 18 appears to have remained a fragment when
leonardo received pressing orders which caused
footnote 59 this passage was evidently intended as an improvement
on that immediately preceding it the purport of both is essentially
the same but the first is pitched in a key of illdisguised
annoyance which is absent from the second i do not see how these
two versions can be reconciled with the romancetheory held by prof
govi do not be aggrieved o devatdar by my delay in responding to
your pressing request for those things which you require of me are
of such a nature that they cannot be well expressed without some
lapse of time particularly because in order to explain the cause
of so great an effect it is necessary to describe with accuracy the
nature of the place and by this means i can afterwards easily
satisfy your abovementioned request footnote 62 this passage was
evidently intended as an improvement on that immediately preceding
it the purport of both is essentially the same but the first is
pitched in a key of illdisguised annoyance which is absent from the
second i do not see how these two versions can be reconciled with
the romancetheory held by prof govi
i will pass over any description of the form of asia minor or as to
what seas or lands form the limits of its outline and extent
because i know that by your own diligence and carefulness in your
studies you have not remained in ignorance of these matters 65
and i will go on to describe the true form of the taurus mountain
which is the cause of this stupendous and harmful marvel and which
will serve to advance us in our purpose 66 this taurus is that
mountain which with many others is said to be the ridge of mount
caucasus but wishing to be very clear about it i desired to speak
to some of the inhabitants of the shores of the caspian sea who
give evidence that this must be the true caucasus and that though
their mountains bear the same name yet these are higher and to
confirm this in the scythian tongue caucasus means a very high
footnote 68 caucasus herodot kaoxaais armen kaukaz peak and
in fact we have no information of there being in the east or in the
west any mountain so high and the proof of this is that the
inhabitants of the countries to the west see the rays of the sun
illuminating a great part of its summit for as much as a quarter of
the longest night and in the same way in those countries which lie
to the east
of the structure and size of mount taurus
footnote 73 the statements are of course founded on those of the
inhabitants spoken of in 1 67 the shadow of this ridge of the
taurus is of such a height that when in the middle of june the sun
is at its meridian its

of the inhabitants spoken of in 1 67
shadow extends as far as the borders of sarmatia twelve days off
and in the middle of december it extends as far as the hyperborean
mountains which are at a months journey to the north 75 and
the side which faces the wind is always free from clouds and mists
because the wind which is parted in beating on the rock closes
again on the further side of that rock and in its motion carries
with it the clouds from all quarters and leaves them where it
strikes and it is always full of thunderbolts from the great
quantity of clouds which accumulate there whence the rock is all
riven and full of huge debris footnote 77 sudden storms are
equally common on the heights of ararat it is hardly necessary to
observe that ararat cannot be meant here its summit is formed like
the crater of vesuvius the peaks sketched on pl cxvicxviii are

tochma su which joins the main river at malatie i have not been
able to discover any map of armenia of the xvth or xvith century in
which the course of the euphrates is laid down with any thing like
the correctness displayed in this sketch the best i have seen is
the catalonian portulan of olivez de majorca executed in 1584 and
it is far behind leonardos this mountain at its base is
inhabited by a very rich population and is full of most beautiful
springs and rivers and is fertile and abounding in all good
produce particularly in those parts which face to the south but
after mounting about three miles we begin to find forests of great
fir trees and beech and other similar trees after this for a
space of three more miles there are meadows and vast pastures and
all the rest as far as the beginning of the taurus is eternal
snows which never disappear at any time and extend to a height of
about fourteen miles in all from this beginning of the taurus up to
the height of a mile the clouds never pass away thus we have
fifteen miles that is a height of about five miles in a straight
line and the summit of the peaks of the taurus are as much or
about that there half way up we begin to find a scorching air and
never feel a breath of wind but nothing can live long there there
nothing is brought forth save a few birds of prey which breed in the
high fissures of taurus and descend below the clouds to seek their
prey above the wooded hills all is bare rock that is from the
clouds upwards and the rock is the purest white and it is
impossible to walk to the high summit on account of the rough and
perilous ascent

having often made you by my letters acquainted with the things
which have happened i think i ought not to be silent as to the
events of the last few days which2
having several times
having many times rejoiced with you by letters over your prosperous
fortunes i know now that as a friend you will be sad with me over
the miserable state in which i find myself and this is that during
the last few days i have been in so much trouble fear peril and
loss besides the miseries of the people here that we have been
envious of the dead and certainly i do not believe that since the
elements by their separation reduced the vast chaos to order they
have ever combined their force and fury to do so much mischief to
man as far as regards us here what we have seen and gone through
is such that i could not imagine that things could ever rise to such
an amount of mischief as we experienced in the space of ten hours
in the first place we were assailed and attacked by the violence and
fury of the winds 10 to this was added the falling of great
mountains of snow which filled up all this valley thus destroying a
great part of our city footnote 11 della nostra citta leonardo
first wrote di questa citta from this we may infer that he had
at some time lived in the place in question wherever it might be
and not content with this the tempest sent a sudden flood of water
to submerge all the low part of this city 12 added to which
there came a sudden rain or rather a ruinous torrent and flood of
water sand mud and stones entangled with roots and stems and
fragments of various trees and every kind of thing flying through
the air fell upon us finally a great fire broke out not brought by
the wind but carried as it would seem by ten thousand devils
which completely burnt up all this neighbourhood and it has not yet
ceased and those few who remain unhurt are in such dejection and
such terror that they hardly have courage to speak to each other as
if they were stunned having abandoned all our business we stay

together small and great footnote 17 certe ruine di chiese
either of armenian churches or of mosques which it was not unusual
to speak of as churches
maschi e femmini insieme unite implies an infringement of the
usually strict rule of the separation of the sexes just like
herds of goats the neighbours out of pity succoured us with
victuals and they had previously been our enemies and if
footnote 18 i vicini nostri nimici the town must then have
stood quite close to the frontier of the country compare 1336 l
7 vicini ai nostri confini dr m jordan has already published
lines 413 see das malerbuch leipzig 1873 p 90his reading
differs from mine under the title of description of a landscape
near lake como we do in fact find among other loose sheets in the
codex atlanticus certain texts referring to valleys of the alps
see nos 1030 1031 and note p 237 and in the arrangement of the
loose sheets of which the codex atlanticus has been formed these
happen to be placed close to this text the compiler stuck both on
the same folio sheet and if this is not the reason for dr jordans
choosing such a title description c i cannot imagine what it can
have been it is at any rate a merely hypothetical statement the
designation of the population of the country round a city as the
enemy nemici is hardly appropriate to italy in the time of
leonardo it had not been for certain people who succoured us with
victuals all would have died of hunger now you see the state we
are in and all these evils are as nothing compared with those which
are promised to us shortly

former letters have shown my joy at your prosperity

that it was written to some other patron and friend whose name and

footnote the first sixteen lines of this passage which treat of
the subject as indicated on the title line have no place in this
connexion and have been omitted

probable that this refers to the natural phenomena which are so

that opposes its furious course 
no otherwise does the northern blast whirl round in its tempestuous
progress 
footnote it may be inferred from the character of the writing
which is in the style of the note in facsimile vol i p 297 that
this passage was written between 1470 and 1480 as the figure 6 at
the end of the text indicates it was continued on another page but
i have searched in vain for it the reverse of this leaf is coloured
red for drawing in silver point but has not been used for that
purpose but for writing on and at about the same date the passages
are given as nos 1217 1218 1219 1162 and no 994 see note page
218 the text given above is obviously not a fragment of a letter
but a record of some personal experience no 1379 also seems to
refer to leonardos journeys in southern italy
nor does the tempestuous sea bellow so loud when the northern blast
dashes it with its foaming waves between scylla and charybdis nor
stromboli nor mount etna when their sulphurous flames having been
forcibly confined rend and burst open the mountain fulminating
stones and earth through the air together with the flames they
vomit
nor when the inflamed caverns of mount etna footnote 13
mongibello is a name commonly given in sicily to mount etna from
djebel arabmountain fr ferrara descrizione dell etna con la

authority of the cronaca del monastero benedettino di licordia of
an eruption of the volcano with a great flow of lava on sept 21
1447 the next records of the mountain are from the years 1533 and
1536 a percy neither does mention any eruptions of etna during the
years to which this note must probably refer memoire des
tremblements de terre de la peninsule italique vol xxii des
memoires couronnees et memoires des savants etrangers academie

a literal interpretation of the passage would not however indicate
an allusion to any great eruption particularly in the connection
with stromboli where the periodical outbreaks in very short
intervals are very striking to any observer especially at night
time when passing the island on the way from naples to messina
rejecting the illrestained element vomit it forth back to its own

be briefly noted below
footnote the numerous corrections the alterations in the figures
l 18 and the absence of any signature prove that this is merely
the rough draft of a letter to lodovico il moro it is one of the
very few manuscripts which are written from left to rightsee the
facsimile of the beginning as here reproduced this is probably the
final sketch of a document the clean of which copy was written in
the usual manner leonardo no doubt very rarely wrote so and this
is probably the reason of the conspicuous dissimilarity in the
handwriting when he did compare pl xxxviii it is noteworthy
too that here the orthography and abbreviations are also
exceptional but such superficial peculiarities are not enough to
stamp the document as altogether spurious it is neither a forgery
nor the production of any artist but leonardo himself as to this
point the contents leave us no doubt as to its authenticity
particularly l 32 see no 719 where this passage is repeated
but whether the fragment as we here see it was written from
leonardos dictationa theory favoured by the orthography the
erasures and correctionsor whether it may be a copy made for or by
melzi or mazenta is comparatively unimportant there are in the
codex atlanticus a few other documents not written by leonardo
himself but the notes in his own hand found on the reverse pages of
these leaves amply prove that they were certainly in leonardos
possession this mark of ownership is wanting to the text in
question but the compilers of the codex atlanticus at any rate
accepted it as a genuine document

1 i have a sort of extremely light and strong bridges adapted to
be most easily carried and with them you may pursue and at any
time flee from the enemy and others secure and indestructible by
fire and battle easy and convenient to lift and place also methods
of burning and destroying those of the enemy
2 i know how when a place is besieged to take the water out of
the trenches and make endless variety of bridges and covered ways
and ladders and other machines pertaining to such expeditions
3 item if by reason of the height of the banks or the strength
of the place and its position it is impossible when besieging a
place to avail oneself of the plan of bombardment i have methods
for destroying every rock or other fortress even if it were founded
on a rock c
4 again i have kinds of mortars most convenient and easy to carry
and with these can fling small stones almost resembling a storm and
with the smoke of these causing great terror to the enemy to his
great detriment and confusion
9 8 and when the fight should be at sea i have kinds of many
machines most efficient for offence and defence and vessels which
will resist the attack of the largest guns and powder and fumes
5 item i have means by secret and tortuous mines and ways made
without noise to reach a designated spot even if it were needed
to pass under a trench or a river
6 item i will make covered chariots safe and unattackable which
entering among the enemy with their artillery there is no body of
men so great but they would break them and behind these infantry
could follow quite unhurt and without any hindrance
7 item in case of need i will make big guns mortars and light
ordnance of fine and useful forms out of the common type
8 where the operation of bombardment should fail i would contrive
catapults mangonels trabocchi and other machines of marvellous
efficacy and not in common use and in short according to the
variety of cases i can contrive various and endless means of
offence and defence
10 in time of peace i believe i can give perfect satisfaction and
to the equal of any other in architecture and the composition of
buildings public and private and in guiding water from one place to
another
item i can carry out sculpture in marble bronze or clay and also
in painting whatever may be done and as well as any other be he
whom he may
32 again the bronze horse may be taken in hand which is to be to
the immortal glory and eternal honour of the prince your father of

i am greatly vexed to be in necessity but i still more regret that
this should be the cause of the hindrance of my wish which is always

perhaps your excellency did not give further orders to messer

i am greatly annoyed that you should have found me in necessity and
that my having to earn my living should have hindered me 
12 it vexes me greatly that having to earn my living has forced me
to interrupt the work and to attend to small matters instead of
following up the work which your lordship entrusted to me but i
hope in a short time to have earned so much that i may carry it out
quietly to the satisfaction of your excellency to whom i commend
myself and if your lordship thought that i had money your lordship
was deceived i had to feed 6 men for 56 months and have had 50

magnificencies have made up your minds to make certain great works

not be so hasty or so quick to give the commission lest by this
haste it should become impossible to select a good model and a good
master and some man of small merit may be chosen who by his
insufficiency may cause you to
footnote 1346 1347 piacenza belonged to milan the lord
spoken of in this letter is no doubt lodovico il moro one may
infer from the concluding sentence no 1346 l 33 34 and no
1347 that leonardo who no doubt compiled this letter did not
forward it to piacenza himself but gave it to some influential
patron under whose name and signature a copy of it was sent to the
commission be abused by your descendants judging that this age
was but ill supplied with men of good counsel and with good masters
seeing that other cities and chiefly the city of the florentines
has been as it were in these very days endowed with beautiful and
grand works in bronze among which are the doors of their
baptistery and this town of florence like piacenza is a place of
intercourse through which many foreigners pass who seeing that
the works are fine and of good quality carry away a good
impression and will say that that city is well filled with worthy
inhabitants seeing the works which bear witness to their opinion
and on the other hand i say seeing so much metal expended and so
badly wrought it were less shame to the city if the doors had been
of plain wood because the material costing so little would not
seem to merit any great outlay of skill
now the principal parts which are sought for in cities are their
cathedrals and of these the first things which strike the eye are
the doors by which one passes into these churches
beware gentlemen of the commission lest too great speed in your
determination and so much haste to expedite the entrusting of so
great a work as that which i hear you have ordered be the cause
that that which was intended for the honour of god and of men should
be turned to great dishonour of your judgments and of your city
which being a place of mark is the resort and gatheringplace of
innumerable foreigners and this dishonour would result if by your
lack of diligence you were to put your trust in some vaunter who by
his tricks or by favour shown to him here should obtain such work
from you by which lasting and very great shame would result to him
and to you thus i cannot help being angry when i consider what men
those are who have conferred with you as wishing to undertake this
great work without thinking of their sufficiency for it not to say
more this one is a potter that one a maker of cuirasses this one
is a bellfounder another a bell ringer and one is even a
bombardier and among them one in his lordships service who
boasted that he was the gossip of messer ambrosio ferrere footnote
26 messer ambrogio ferrere was farmer of the customs under the
duke piacenza at that time belonged to milan who has some power
and who has made him some promises and if this were not enough he
would mount on horseback and go to his lord and obtain such letters
that you could never refuse to give him the work but consider
where masters of real talent and fit for such work are brought when
they have to compete with such men as these open your eyes and look
carefully lest your money should be spent in buying your own
disgrace i can declare to you that from that place you will procure
none but average works of inferior and coarse masters there is no
capable man33 and you may believe meexcept leonardo the
florentine who is making the equestrian statue in bronze of the
duke francesco and who has no need to bring himself into notice
because he has work for all his life time and i doubt whether
being so great a work he will ever finish it 34
the miserable painstakers  with what hope may they expect a
reward of their merit
1347
there is one whom his lordship invited from florence to do this work
and who is a worthy master but with so very much business he will
never finish it and you may imagine that a difference there is to
be seen between a beautiful object and an ugly one quote pliny

magnificent presidenthaving ofttimes remembered the proposals
made many times to me by your excellency i take the liberty of
writing to remind your lordship of the promise made to me at my last
departure that is the possession of the twelve inches of water
granted to me by the most christian king your lordship knows that i
did not enter into possession because at that time when it was
given to me there was a dearth of water in the canal as well by
reason of the great drought as also because the outlets were not
regulated but your excellency promised me that as soon as this was
done i should have my rights afterwards hearing that the canal was
complete i wrote several times to your lordship and to messer
girolamo da cusanowho has in his keeping the deed of this gift and
so also i wrote to corigero and never had a reply i now send
thither salai my pupil the bearer of this to whom your lordship
may tell by word of mouth all that happened in the matter about
which i petition your excellency i expect to go thither this easter
since i am nearly at the end of my lawsuit and i will take with me
two pictures of our lady which i have begun and at the present time
have brought them on to a very good end nothing else occurs to me
my lord the love which your excellency has always shown me and the
benefits that i have constantly received from you i have hitherto
i am fearful lest the small return i have made for the great
benefits i have received from your excellency may not have made you
somewhat annoyed with me and this is why to many letters which i
have written to your excellency i have never had an answer i now
send to you salai to explain to your excellency that i am almost at
the end of my litigation with my brothers and that i hope to be
with you this easter and carry with me two pictures on which are two
madonnas of different sizes which i began for the most christian
king or for whomsoever you please i should be very glad to know
where on my return from this place i shall have to reside because
i do not wish to give more trouble to your lordship and then
having worked for the most christian king whether my salary is to
be continued or not i write to the president as to the water that
the king granted me of which i had not been put in possession by
reason of the dearth in the canal caused by the great drought and
because its outlets were not regulated but he promised me certainly
that as soon as the regulation was made i should be put in
possession of it i therefore pray you that if you should meet the
said president you would be good enough now that the outlets are
regulated to remind the said president to cause me to be put in
possession of that water since i understand it is in great measure
in his power nothing else occurs to me always yours to command
good day to you messer francesco why in gods name of all the
letters i have written to you have you never answered one now wait
till i come by god and i shall make you write so much that perhaps
you will become sick of it
dear messer francesco i am sending thither salai to learn from his
magnificence the president to what end the regulation of the water
has come since at my departure this regulation of the outlets of
the canal had been ordered because his magnificence the president
promised me that as soon as this was done i should be satisfied it
is now some time since i heard that the canal was in order as also
its outlets and i immediately wrote to the president and to you
and then i repeated it and never had an answer so you will have
the goodness to answer me as to that which happened and as i am not
to hurry the matter would you take the trouble for the love of me
to urge the president a little and also messer girolamo cusano to
whom you will commend me and offer my duty to his magnificence

restoration of your health that it almost had the effect that my

illness left me of your excellencys almost restored health but
i am extremely vexed that i have not been able completely to satisfy
the wishes of your excellency by reason of the wickedness of that
deceiver for whom i left nothing undone which could be done for him
by me and by which i might be of use to him and in the first place
his allowances were paid to him before the time which i believe he
would willingly deny if i had not the writing signed by myself and
the interpreter and i seeing that he did not work for me unless he
had no work to do for others which he was very careful in
solliciting invited him to dine with me and to work afterwards
near me because besides the saving of expense he

lived in the vatican and it may be safely inferred from no 1352 l

from the following unpublished notice in the vatican archives which

of leonardos relation to the often named giorgio tedesco

from this we learn that seven ducats formed the germans monthly
wages but according to no 1353 l 7 he pretended that eight ducats
had been agreed upon
would acquire the italian language he always promised but would
never do so and this i did also because that giovanni the german
who makes the mirrors was there always in the workshop and wanted
to see and to know all that was being done there and made it known
outside  strongly criticising it and because he dined with those
of the popes guard and then they went out with guns killing birds
among the ruins and this went on from after dinner till the
evening and when i sent lorenzo to urge him to work he said that he
would not have so many masters over him and that his work was for
your excellencys wardrobe and thus two months passed and so it
went on and one day finding gian niccolo of the wardrobe and asking
whether the german had finished the work for your magnificence he
told me this was not true but only that he had given him two guns
to clean afterwards when i had urged him farther be left the
workshop and began to work in his room and lost much time in making
another pair of pincers and files and other tools with screws and
there he worked at mills for twisting silk which he hid when any one
of my people went in and with a thousand oaths and mutterings so
that none of them would go there any more
i was so greatly rejoiced most illustrious lord by the desired
restoration of your health that my own illness almost left me but
i am greatly vexed at not having been able to completely satisfy
your excellencys wishes by reason of the wickedness of that german
deceiver for whom i left nothing undone by which i could have hope
to please him and secondly i invited him to lodge and board with
me by which means i should constantly see the work he was doing and
with greater ease correct his errors while besides this he would
learn the italian tongue by means of which be could with more ease
talk without an interpreter his moneys were always given him in
advance of the time when due afterwards he wanted to have the
models finished in wood just as they were to be in iron and wished
to carry them away to his own country but this i refused him
telling him that i would give him in drawing the breadth length
height and form of what he had to do and so we remained in
illwill
the next thing was that he made himself another workshop and pincers
and tools in his room where he slept and there he worked for
others afterwards he went to dine with the swiss of the guard
where there are idle fellows in which he beat them all and most
times they went two or three together with guns to shoot birds
among the ruins and this went on till evening
at last i found how this master giovanni the mirrormaker was he who
had done it all for two reasons the first because he had said that
my coming here had deprived him of the countenance and favour of
your lordship which always the other is that he said that his
ironworkers rooms suited him for working at his mirrors and of
this he gave proof for besides making him my enemy he made him
sell all he had and leave his workshop to him where he works with a
number of workmen making numerous mirrors to send to the fairs
1352
i was so greatly rejoiced most illustrious lord by the wished for
recovery of your health that my own ills have almost left me and i
say god be praised for it but it vexes me greatly that i have not
been able completely to satisfy your excellencys wishes by reason
of the wickedness of that german deceiver for whom i left nothing
undone by which i could hope to please him and secondly i invited
him to lodge and board with me by which means i should see
constantly the work he was doing for which purpose i would have a
table fixed at the foot of one of these windows where he could work
with the file and finish the things made below and so i should
constantly see the work he might do and it could be corrected with
greater ease

this other hindered me in anatomy blaming it before the pope and
likewise at the hospital and he has filled 4 this whole
belvedere with workshops for mirrors and he did the same thing in
maestro giorgios room he said that he had been promised 7 eight
ducats every month beginning with the first day when he set out
or at latest when he spoke with you and that you agreed
seeing that he seldom stayed in the workshop and that he ate a
great deal i sent him word that if he liked i could deal with him
separately for each thing that he might make and would give him
what we might agree to be a fair valuation he took counsel with his
neighbour and gave up his room selling every thing and went to
find

1354footnote a puzzling passage meant as it would seem for a
jest compare the description of giants in dante inf xxi and

myth relates that he was a son of ge that he fed on lions that he
hunted in libya and killed the inhabitants he enjoyed the
peculiarity of renewing his strength whenever he fell and came in
contact with his mother earth but that hercules lifted him up and
so conquered and strangled him lucan gives a full account of the

himself almost covered by the multitude he suddenly perceives the
smarting of the stabs and sent forth a roar which sounded like a
terrific clap of thunder and placing his hands on the ground he
raised his terrible face and having lifted one hand to his head he
found it full of men and rabble sticking to it like the minute
creatures which not unfrequently are found there wherefore with a
shake of his head he sends the men flying through the air just as
hail does when driven by the fury of the winds many of these men
were found to be dead stamping with his feet

they will not be treated differently to myself by other men and in

few whom his vices have disgusted and he only dislikes those men
whose natures are contrary to those vices and many hate their
fathers and break off friendship with those who reprove their
vices and he will not permit any examples against them nor any
advice
if you meet with any one who is virtuous do not drive him from you
do him honour so that he may not have to flee from you and be
reduced to hiding in hermitages or caves or other solitary places
to escape from your treachery if there is such an one among you do
him honour for these are our saints upon earth these are they who
deserve statues from us and images but remember that their images
are not to be eaten by you as is still done in some parts of india
footnote 15 in explanation of this passage i have received the
following communication from dr g w leitner of lahore so far as
indian customs are known to us this practice spoken of by leonardo
as still existing in some parts of india is perfectly unknown and
it is equally opposed to the spirit of hinduism mohammedanism and
sikhism in central thibet the ashes of the dead when burnt are
mixed with dough and small figuresusually of buddhaare stamped
out of them and some are laid in the grave while others are
distributed among the relations the custom spoken of by leonardo
may have prevailed there but i never heard of it possibly leonardo
refers here to customs of nations of america where when the
images have according to them performed some miracle the priests
cut them in pieces being of wood and give them to all the people
of the country not without payment and each one grates his portion
very fine and puts it upon the first food he eats and thus
believes that by faith he has eaten his saint who then preserves him
from all perils what do you think here man of your own species

miscellaneous notes
the incidental memoranda scattered here and there throughout the
mss can have been for the most part intelligible to the writer
only in many cases their meaning and connection are all the more
obscure because we are in ignorance about the persons with whom
leonardo used to converse nor can we say what part he may have
played in the various events of his time vasari and other early
biographers give us a very superficial and far from accurate picture
of leonardos private life though his own memoranda referring for
the most part to incidents of no permanent interest do not go far
towards supplying this deficiency they are nevertheless of some
importance and interest as helping us to solve the numerous
mysteries in which the history of leonardos long life remains
involved we may at any rate assume from leonardos having
committed to paper notes on more or less trivial matters on his
pupils on his housekeeping on various known and unknown
personages and a hundred other trifiesthat at the time they must
have been in some way important to him
i have endeavoured to make these miscellaneous notes as complete
as possible for in many cases an incidental memorandum will help to
explain the meaning of some other note of a similar kind the first
portion of these notes nos l379l457 as well as those referring
to his pupils and to other artists and artificers who lived in his
house 14581468 are arranged in chronological order a
considerable proportion of these notes belong to the period between
1490 and 1500 when leonardo was living at milan under the patronage
of lodovico il moro a time concerning which we have otherwise only
very scanty information if leonardo did reallyas has always been
supposedspend also the greater part of the preceding decade in
milan it seems hardly likely that we should not find a single note
indicative of the fact or referring to any event of that period on
the numerous loose leaves in his writing that exist leonardos life
in milan between 1489 and 1500 must have been comparatively
uneventful the mss and memoranda of those years seem to prove that
it was a tranquil period of intellectual and artistic labour rather
than of bustling court life whatever may have been the fate of the
mss and note books of the foregoing yearswhether they were
destroyed by leonardo himself or have been lostit is certainly
strange that nothing whatever exists to inform us as to his life and
doings in milan earlier than the consecutive series of manuscripts
which begin in the year 1489
there is nothing surprising in the fact that the notes regarding
his pupils are few and meagre excepting for the record of money
transactions only very exceptional circumstances would have prompted
him to make any written observations on the persons with whom he was
in daily intercourse among whom of course were his pupils of
them all none is so frequently mentioned as salai but the character
of the notes does notas it seems to mejustify us in supposing
that he was any thing more than a sort of factotum of leonardos
see 1519 note
leonardos quotations from books and his lists of titles supply
nothing more than a hint as to his occasional literary studies or
recreations it was evidently no part of his ambition to be deeply
read see nrs 10 11 1159 and he more than once expressly states
in various passages which will be found in the foregoing sections
that he did not recognise the authority of the ancients on
scientific questions which in his day was held paramount
archimedes is the sole exception and leonardo frankly owns his
admiration for the illustrious greek to whose genius his own was so
much akin see no 1476 all his notes on various authors
excepting those which have already been inserted in the previous
section have been arranged alphabetically for the sake of
convenience 14691508
the passages next in order contain accounts and inventories
principally of household property the publication of theseoften
very trivial entriesis only justifiable as proving that the
wealth the splendid mode of life and lavish expenditure which have
been attributed to leonardo are altogether mythical unless we put
forward the very improbable hypothesis that these notes as to money
in hand outlay and receipts refer throughout to an exceptional
state of his affairs viz when he was short of money
the memoranda collected at the end no 15051565 are in the
original in the usual writing from left to right besides the
style of the handwriting is at variance with what we should expect
it to be if really leonardo himself had written these notes most
of them are to be found in juxtaposition with undoubtedly authentic
writing of his but this may be easily explained if we take into
account the fact that leonardo frequently wrote on loose sheets he
may therefore have occasionally used paper on which others had made
short memoranda for the most part as it would seem for his use at
the end of all i have given leonardos will from the copy of it
preserved in the melzi library it has already been printed by
amoretti and by uzielli it is not known what has become of the
original document

the mysterious looking words quite distinctly written in line 1
ingol amor a ilopan a and on line 2 enoiganod al are
obviously in cipher and the solution is a simple one by reading
them backwards we find for ingol logniprobably longi
evidently the name of a person for amor a a roma for ilopan
a a napoli leonardo has done the same in two passages treating
on some secrets of his art nos 641 and 729 the only other places
in which we find this cipher employed we may therefore conclude
that it was for the sake of secrecy that he used it
there can be no doubt from the tenor of this passage that leonardo
projected a secret excursion to naples nothing has hitherto been
known of this journey but the significance of the passage will be
easily understood by a reference to the following notes from which
we may infer that leonardo really had at the time plans for
travelling further than naples from lines 3 4 and 7 it is evident
that he purposed after selling every thing that was not easily
portable to leave a chest in the care of his relations at vinci
his luggage was to be packed into two trunks especially adapted for
transport by mules the exact meaning of many sentences in the
following notes must necessarily remain obscure these brief remarks
on small and irrelevant affairs and so forth are however of no
historical value the notes referring to the preparations for his
journey are more intelligible

at the time and which now seems to be lost
mr alfred marks of long ditton in his valuable
paper read before the royal soc of literature
june 28 1882 on the st anne of leonardo da
vinci has adduced proof that the cartoon now in the
royal academy was executed earlier at milan the note
here given which is written on the sheet containing
the study for the said cartoon has evidently no
reference to the drawing on which it is written
but is obviously of the same date though i have
not any opening here for discussing this question of
the cartoon it seemed to me important to point out
that the character of the writing in this note does
not confirm the opinion hitherto held that the royal
academy cartoon was the one described by vasari
but on the contrary supports the hypothesis put
forward by mr marks

out after the publication of this work of mine after
the much regretted death of the elder marchese his
son the marchese gioachino dadda was so liberal
as to place these ms materials at my disposal for
the present work through the kind intervention of
signor gustavo frizzoni the following passages
with the initials g da are prints from the valuable
notes in that publication the ms additions i have
marked i did not however think myself justified
in reproducing here the acute and interesting
observations on the contents of most of the rare books
here enumerated

observations that follow refer to events of the previous month of last year dell anno passato leonardo
cannot therefore have written thus in florence where
the year was at that period calculated as beginning
in the month of march see vol i no 4 note 2
he must then have been in milan what is more
important is that we thus learn how to date the
beginning of the year in all the notes written at
milan this clears up uziellis doubts a milano

if any man could have discovered the
utmost powers of the cannon in all its
various forms and have given such a secret
to the romans with what rapidity would
they have conquered every country and have
vanquished every army and what reward could
have been great enough for such a service
archimedes indeed although he had greatly
damaged the romans in the siege of syra
cuse nevertheless did not fail of being offered
great rewards from these very romans and
when syracuse was taken diligent search was
made for archimedes and he being found
dead greater lamentation was made for him
by the senate and people of rome than if
they had lost all their army and they
did not fail to honour him with burial and
with a statue at their head was marcus
marcellus and after the second destruction
of syracuse the sepulchre of archimedes was
found again by cato25 in the ruins of a
temple so cato had the temple restored and
the sepulchre he so highly honoured

was not so proud of any thing he had done
as of having paid such honour to archimedes

we are composed of two things that is soul
and body of which the first is the better
the body is the inferior wisdom belongs

to the worse part and is the worst of all

chief evil wisdom is the chief good of the
soul that is with the wise man and nothing

the ships should have tall masts and that on
their tops there should be a spar fixed footnote 6 compare no 1115 of
40 feet long and one third of a foot thick at
one end of this was a small grappling iron and
at the other a counterpoise and there was also
attached 12 feet of chain and at the end of
this chain as much rope as would reach from
the chain to the base of the top where it was
fixed with a small rope from this base it ran
down to the bottom of the mast where a
very strong spar was attached and to this
was fastened the end of the rope but to go on
to the use of his machine i say that below
this grappling iron was a fire footnote 14 compare no 1128 which with

no avail for ascertaining the effects of large
ones and i here propose to prove that
this conclusion is a false one and chiefly
by bringing forward the very same argument
which led him to this conclusion that is by
an experiment with an auger for he proves
that if a man by a certain exertion of
strength makes a hole of a given diameter
and afterwards another hole of double the
diameter this cannot be made with only
double the exertion of the mans strength

by multiplying the second diameter of a circle
by half its circumference produced a rectangular

footnote in the original the passage given as no 1463
is written between lines 2 and 3 of this text and
it is possible that the entries in lines 3 and 4 refer
to the payments of jacopo tedesco who is there
mentioned the first words of these lines are very
illegible
7 al fattore il fattore was as is well known
the nickname of giovanni franceso penni born in
florence in 1486 and subsequently a pupil of raphaels
according to vasari he was known by it
even as a boy whether he is spoken of in this
passage or whether the word fattore should be translated
literally i will not undertake to decide the
latter seems to me more probably right

says too that this address is of the year 1509 and
mr ravaisson remarks de cette suscription il semble
quon peut inferer que leonard etait alors en france a
la cour de louis xii  pour conclure je crois quil
nest pas prouve que leonard de vinci nait pas fait un
voyage de quelques mois en france sous louis xii entre
le printemps de 1509 et lautomne de 1510i must
confess that i myself have not succeeded in deciphering
completely this french writing of which two
words remain to me doubtful but so much seems to
be quite evident that this is not an address of a letter
at all but a certificate or note amboisel 6 i believe
to be the signature of charles damboise the
governor of milan if this explanation is the right
one it can be easily explained by the contents of
nos 1350 and 1529 the note line 1 was perhaps
added later by another hand and leonardo himself
wrote afterwards on the same sheet some geometrical
explanations i must also point out that the
statement that this sheet belongs to the year 1509
has absolutely no foundation in fact there is no
clue whatever for giving a precise date to this note
