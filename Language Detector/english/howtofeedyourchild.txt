part i
the care of children
bathing
at what age may a child be given a full tub bath
usually when ten days old it should not be given before the cord has
come off
how should the bath be given
it should not be given sooner than one hour after feeding the room
should be warm if possible there should be an open fire the head and
face should first be washed and dried then the body should be soaped
and the infant placed in the tub with its body well supported by the
hand of the nurse the bath should be given quickly and the body
dried rapidly with a soft towel but with very little rubbing
at what temperature should the bath be given
for the first few weeks at 100 f later during early infancy at
98 f after six months at 95 f during the second year from 85
to 90 f
with what should the bath be given
soft sponges are useful for bathing the body limbs and scalp there
should be a separate washcloth for the face and another for the
buttocks
what are the objections to bath sponges
when used frequently they become very dirty and are liable to cause
infection of the eyes mouth or genital organs
under what circumstances should the daily tub bath be omitted
in the case of very feeble or delicate infants on account of the
exposure and fatigue and in all forms of acute illness except by
direction of the physician in eczema and many other forms of skin
disease much harm is often done by bathing with soap and water or
even with water alone
genital organs
how should the genital organs of a female child be cleansed
best with fresh absorbent cotton and tepid water or a solution of
boric acid two teaspoonfuls to the pint this should be done
carefully at least once a day if any discharge is present the
boricacid solution should invariably be used twice a day great care
is necessary at all times to prevent infection which often arises from
soiled napkins
how should the genital organs of a male child be cleansed
in infancy and early childhood the foreskin should be pushed back at
least twice a week while the child is in his bath and the parts thus
exposed washed gently with absorbent cotton and water
if the foreskin is tightly adherent and cannot readily be pushed back
the physicians attention should be called to it the nurse or mother
should not attempt forcible stretching
when is circumcision advisable
usually when the foreskin is very long and so tight that it cannot be
pushed back without force always when this condition is accompanied
by evidences of local irritation or difficulty in passing water
eyes
how should the eyes of a little baby be cleansed
with a piece of soft linen or absorbent cotton and a lukewarm solution
of salt or boric acidone half of an even teaspoonful to one pint of
water
if pus appears in the eyes what should be done
they should be cleansed every hour with a solution of boric acid ten
grains to one ounce of water if the lids stick together a little
vaseline from a tube should be rubbed upon them at night if the
trouble is slight this treatment will control it if it is severe a
physician should be called immediately as delay may result in loss of
eyesight
mouth
how is an infants mouth to be cleansed
an excellent method is by the use of a swab made by twisting a bit of
absorbent cotton upon a wooden toothpick with this the folds between
the gums and lips and cheeks may be gently and carefully cleansed
twice a day unless the mouth is sore it is not necessary after every
feeding the finger of the nurse often employed is too large and
liable to injure the delicate mucous membrane
what is sprue
it appears on the lips and inside the cheeks like little white threads
or flakes it is also called thrush in bad cases it may cover the
tongue and the whole of the inside of the mouth
how should a mouth be cleansed when there is sprue
it should be washed carefully after every feeding or nursing with a
solution of borax or bicarbonate of soda baking soda one even
teaspoonful to three ounces of water and four times a day the
boricacid solution mentioned should be used
skin
how should the infants skin be cared for to prevent chafing
first not too much nor too strong soap should be used secondly
careful rinsing of the body thirdly not too vigorous rubbing either
during or after the bath fourthly the use of dusting powder in all
the folds of the skinunder the arms behind the ears about the
neck in the groin etc this is of the utmost importance in very fat
infants
if the skin is very sensitive and chafing easily produced what
should be done
no soap should be used but bran or salt baths given instead
how should a bran bath be prepared
one pint of wheat bran should be placed in a bag of coarse muslin or
cheesecloth and this put in the bath water it should then be
squeezed for five minutes until the water resembles a thin porridge
how should a salt bath be prepared
a teacupful of common salt or sea salt should be used to each two
gallons of water
how should the buttocks be cared for
this is the most common place for chafing as the parts are so
frequently wet and soiled hence the utmost pains should be taken that
all napkins be removed as soon as they are wet or soiled and the
parts kept scrupulously clean
if the parts have become chafed what should be done
only bran and salt baths should be used and in very severe cases even
these may have to be omitted for a day or two the parts may be
cleansed with sweet oil and a little absorbent cotton and the skin
kept covered with a dusting powder composed of starch two parts boric
acid one part
what is prickly heat and how is it produced
it consists of fine red pimples and is caused by excessive
perspiration and the irritation of flannel underclothing
how should it be treated
muslin or linen should be put next to the skin the entire body should
be sponged frequently with equal parts of vinegar and water and
plenty of the starch and boricacid powder mentioned should be used
clothing
what are the most essential things in the clothing of infants
that the chest shall be covered with soft flannel the limbs well
protected but not confined and the abdomen supported by a broad
flannel band which should be snug but not too tight it is important
that the clothing should fit the body if it is too tight it
interferes with the free movements of the chest in breathing and by
pressing upon the stomach sometimes causes the infant to vomit soon
after swallowing its food if the clothing is too loose it is soon
thrown into deep folds or bunches which cause much discomfort no
pins should be used but instead all bands about the body should be
basted the petticoats should be supported by shoulder straps
how should the infant be held during dressing and undressing
nothing is more awkward than to attempt to dress a young baby in a
sitting posture it should lie upon the nurses lap until quite old
enough to sit alone the clothing being drawn over the childs feet
not slipped over the head
of what use is the band
it protects the abdomen but its most important use is to support the
abdominal walls in very young infants and in this way to prevent the
occurrence of rupture
how long is this band required
the snug flannel band not usually more than four months in healthy
infants this may then be replaced by the knitted band which may be
worn up to eighteen months the band is an important article of dress
in the case of thin infants whose abdominal organs are not
sufficiently protected by fat with such or with those prone to
diarrhoea it is often advisable to continue the band until the third
year
what changes are to be made in the clothing of infants in the
summer
only the thinnest gauze flannel undershirts should be worn and
changes in temperature should be met by changes in the outer garments
the greatest care should be taken that children are not kept too hot
in the middle of the day while extra wraps should be used morning and
evening especially at the seashore or in the mountains
should older children be allowed to go with their legs bare
if strong and well there is no objection to this in very hot weather
in cold weather however it is doubtful if any children are benefited
by it particularly in a changeable climate like that of new york
many delicate children are certainly injured by such attempts at
hardening
what sort of underclothing should be worn during cold weather
never the heaviest weight even in winter four grades are usually
sold the next to the heaviest being thick enough for any child
do little children require as heavy flannels as older people
not as a rule they usually live in a warm nursery their circulation
is active and they always perspire easily during their play when
they go out of doors the addition of coats and leggings renders thick
flannels unnecessary
are not many little children clothed too thinly for the ordinary
house
very few the almost invariable mistake made in city homes is that of
excessive clothing and too warm rooms these two things are among the
most frequent reasons for their taking cold so easily
napkins
how should napkins be taken care of
they should he immediately removed from the nursery when soiled or
wet soiled napkins should be kept in a receptacle with a tight cover
and washed as soon as possible
should napkins which have been only wet be used a second time without
washing
it is no doubt better to use only fresh napkins but there is no
serious objection to using them twice unless there is chafing of the
skin clean napkins changed as soon as wet or soiled are of much
importance in keeping the skin healthy
what are the important things to be observed in washing napkins
soiled napkins should not be allowed to dry but should receive a
rough washing at once they should then be kept in soak in plain water
until a convenient time for washingat least once every daywhen
they should be washed in hot suds and boiled at least fifteen minutes
afterward they should be very thoroughly rinsed or they may irritate
the skin and ironed without starch or blueing they should never be
used when clamp
nursery
what are the essentials in a good nursery
the furnishings should be very simple and unnecessary hangings and
upholstered furniture should be excluded as large a room as possible
should be selectedone that is well ventilated and always one in
which the sun shines at some part of the day as it should be
remembered that an average child spends here at least three fourths of
its time during the first year the nursery should have dark shades at
the windows but no extra hangings or curtains about the babys crib
nothing but what can be washed should be allowed the air should be
kept as fresh and as pure as possible there should be no plumbing no
drying of napkins or clothes no cooking of food and no gas burning
at night a small wax nightlight answers every purpose
how should a nursery be heated
best by an open fire next to this by a franklin stove the ordinary
hotair furnace of cities has many objections but it is not so bad as
steam heat from a radiator in the room a gas stove is even worse than
this and should never be used except perhaps for a few minutes
during the morning bath
at what temperature should a nursery be kept during the day
best 66 to 68 f measured by a thermometer hanging three feet from
the floor never should the temperature be allowed to go above 70 f
at what temperature during the night
during the first two or three months not below 65 f after three
months the temperature may go as low as 55 f after the first year it
may be 50 or even 45 f
at what age may the window be left open at night
usually after the third month except when the outside temperature is
below freezing point
how often should the nursery be aired
at least twice a dayin the morning after the childs bath and again
in the evening before the child is put to bed for the night this
should be done thoroughly and the child should be removed meanwhile
to another apartment it is well to air the nursery whenever the child
is out of the room
what symptoms are seen in a child who is kept in too hot a room
it becomes pale loses appetite shows symptoms of indigestion
occasionally vomits stops gaining in weight perspires very much and
takes cold easily because of this and also because of the great
difference between the indoor and outdoor temperatures its condition
may be such as to lead one to suspect very serious illness
airing
how early may airing indoors he commenced and how long may it be
continued
airing in the room may be begun even in cold weather when the child
is one month old at first for only fifteen minutes at a time this
period may be gradually lengthened by ten or fifteen minutes each day
until it is four or five hours this airing may be continued in almost
all kinds of weather
is there not great danger of a young babys taking cold when aired in
this manner
not if the period is at first short and the baby accustomed to it
gradually instead of rendering the child liable to take cold it is
the best means of preventing colds
how should such an airing be given
the child should be dressed with bonnet and light coat as if for the
street and placed in its crib or carriage which should stand a few
feet from the window all the windows are then thrown wide open but
the doors closed to prevent draughts screens are unnecessary
at what age may a child go out of doors
in summer when one week old in spring and fall usually at about one
month in winter when about three months old on pleasant days being
kept in the sun and out of the wind
what are the best hours for airing out of doors
in summer and early autumn a child may be out almost any time between
seven in the morning and sunset in winter and early spring a young
child only between 10 or 11 am and 3 pm although this depends
somewhat upon the climate in new york and along the atlantic coast
the early mornings are apt to be damp and the afternoons raw and
cloudy
on what kind of days should a baby not go out
in sharp winds when the ground is covered with melting snow and when
it is extremely cold a child under four months old should not usually
go out if the thermometer is below freezing point nor one under eight
months old if it is below 20 f
what are the most important things to be attended to when the child
is out in its carriage
to see that the wind never blows in its face that its feet are
properly covered and warm and that the sun is never allowed to shine
directly into its eyes when the child is either asleep or awake
of what advantage to the child is going out
fresh air is required to renew and purify the blood and this is just
as necessary for health and growth as proper food
what are the effects produced in infants by fresh air
the appetite is improved the digestion is better the cheeks become
red and all signs of health are seen
is there any advantage in having a child take its airing during the
first five or six months in the nurses arms
none whatever a child can be made much more comfortable in a baby
carriage and can be equally well protected against exposure by
blankets and the carriage umbrella
what are the objections to an infants sleeping out of doors
there are no real objections it is not true that infants take cold
more easily when asleep than awake while it is almost invariably the
case that those who sleep out of doors are stronger children and less
prone to take cold than others
what can be done for children who take cold upon the slightest
provocation
they should be kept in cool rooms especially when asleep they should
not wear such heavy clothing that they are in a perspiration much of
the time every morning the body particularly the chest and back
should be sponged with cold water 50 to 60 f
how should this cold sponge bath be given
the child should stand in a tub containing a little warm water and a
large bath sponge filled with cold water should be squeezed two or
three times over the body this should be followed by a vigorous
rubbing with a towel until the skin is quite red this may be used at
three years and often at two years for infants a little higher
temperature 65 to 70 may be used
weight growth and development
of what importance is the weight of the child
nothing else tells so accurately how well it is thriving
during the first year a record of the weight is almost indispensable
throughout childhood it is of much interest and is the best guide to
the physical condition it will well repay any mother or nurse to keep
such a record
how frequently should a child be weighed
every week during the first six months and at least once in two weeks
during the last six months of the first year during the second year a
child should be weighed at least once a month
how rapidly should an infant gain in weight during the first year
there is usually a loss during the first week of from four to eight
ounces after this a healthy child should gain from four to eight
ounces a week up to about the sixth month from six to twelve months
the gain is less usually from two to four ounces a week
is it to be expected that bottlefed infants will gain as rapidly as
those who are nursed
they seldom do so during the first month after that time under
favourable circumstances the gain is usually quite as regular and
during the latter half of the first year it is likely to be more
continuous than in a nursing infant because the latter usually loses
weight at the time of weaning
why do they not gain so rapidly at first
it takes a few weeks for the stomach to become accustomed to cows
milk and until this is accomplished it is necessary to make the milk
very weak or the childs digestion will be upset
for a child of average weight at birth seven to seven and a half
pounds what should be the weight at the different periods during the
first year
at three months it should be twelve to thirteen pounds at six months
fifteen to sixteen pounds at nine months seventeen to eighteen
pounds at one year twenty to twentytwo pounds at five months a
healthy child will usually double its weight and at twelve months it
will nearly treble its weight
do all healthy infants gain steadily in weight during the first
year
as a rule they do yet it is seldom the case that one gains every week
for the entire year with most infants there are from time to time
periods of a few weeks in which no gain is made these are more often
seen from the seventh to the tenth month and frequently occur when the
child is cutting teeth sometimes during very hot weather
is it true that every infant who gains rapidly in weight is thriving
normally
not invariably some who are fed upon prepared infant foods increase
rapidly in weight but not in strength nor in their development in
other respects
is the weight of as much value in the second year as a guide to the
childs condition
after the first year the gain in weight is seldom continuous there
are many interruptions some depend on season and others often occur
without apparent cause
at what age should the fontanel close
the average is about eighteen months it seldom closes earlier than
fourteen months and it should not be open at two years
at what age should a child hold up its head
as a rule during the fourth month and often during the third month
the head can be held erect when the body is supported
when does an infant first laugh aloud
usually from the third to the fifth month
when does it begin to reach for toys and handle them
usually from the fifth to the seventh month
at what age should a child be able to sit and to stand alone
at seven or eight months a healthy child is usually able to sit erect
and support the body during the ninth and tenth months are usually
seen the first attempts to bear the weight upon the feet and at
eleven or twelve months most children can stand with assistance
when should a child walk alone
the first attempts are generally seen in the twelfth or thirteenth
month at fifteen or sixteen months the average child is able to run
alone
what conditions postpone these events
prematurity a very delicate constitution any severe or prolonged
illness and especially chronic disturbances of digestion making
feeding difficult a common cause of late sitting standing or
walking is rickets
should a child be urged to walk
never he is usually quite willing to do so as soon as his muscles and
bones are strong enough none of the contrivances for teaching
children to walk are to be advised
when do children begin to talk
generally at one year a child can say papa and mamma or other
single words at the end of the second year the average child is able
to put words together in short sentences
if at two years the child makes no attempt to speak what should be
suspected
either that the child is a deafmute or that it is mentally deficient
although this is occasionally seen in children who are only very
backward

    the weight of girls is on the average about one pound less than
    boys they are about the same in height
    charts showing weight curve for the first year and from one year
    to fourteen years are given at the end of this book
dentition
how many teeth are there in the first set
twenty
what is the time of their appearance
the two central lower teeth are usually the first to appear and come
from the fifth to the ninth month next are the four upper central
teeth which come from the eighth to the twelfth month the other two
lower central teeth and the four front double teeth come from the
twelfth to the eighteenth month then follow the four canine teeth
the two upper ones being known as the eye teeth and the two lower
as the stomach teeth they generally come between the eighteenth and
the twentyfourth month the four back double teeth which complete
the first set come between the twentyfourth and thirtieth month
  at one year a child usually has six teeth
  at one and a half years twelve teeth
  at two years sixteen teeth
  at two and a half years twenty teeth
what are the causes of variation
the time of appearance of the teeth varies in different families in
some they come very early in others much later the teeth may come
late as a result of prolonged illness and also from rickets
what symptoms are commonly seen with teething
in healthy children there is very often fretfulness and poor sleep for
two or three nights there may be loss of appetite so that only one
half the usual amount of food is taken there is salivation or
drooling and often slight fever there may be some symptoms of
indigestion such as vomiting or the appearance of undigested food in
the stools in delicate children all these symptoms may be much more
severe
how long do these symptoms last
usually only three or four days but there may be no gain in weight
for two or three weeks
what is the cause of most of the other symptoms attributed to
teething
nearly all of them come from indigestion due to bad feeding
part ii
infant feeding
what is the best infant food
mothers milk
of what is mothers milk composed
thirteen parts solids and eightyseven parts water
what are the solids
fat sugar proteids and salts
what is the fat
the cream
what is the sugar
it is lactose or milk sugar
what are the proteids
the curd of the milk
are all these elements necessary
yes we cannot expect to rear a healthy infant unless they are all in
his food
of what use is the fat
it is needed for the growth of the bones the nerves the fat of the
body and the production of heat
of what use is the sugar
it is needed for the production of heat and to make fat in the body
of what use are the proteids
they are needed for the growth of the cells of the body such as those
of the blood the various organs and the muscles
of what use are the salts
particularly for the growth of bone
of what use is the water
by means of the water the food is kept in a state of minute
subdivision or in solution so that the delicate organs of a young
infant can digest it it is also necessary to enable the body to get
rid of its waste
nursing
should all mothers attempt to nurse their children
as a rule they should do so but there are many conditions when they
should not
what are the most important ones
if the mother has or has had tuberculosis or any other serious chronic
disease or is herself in very delicate health she should not try
she is likely soon to fail in nourishing her child and the attempt
may do herself much harm as well as injure the child
how often should infants be nursed during the first two days of
life
usually only four or five times daily since there is very little milk
secreted at this time
when does the milk come in abundance
usually on the third day sometimes not until the fourth or fifth day
should the infant be fed anything additional during the first two
days
usually not if much food were necessary we may be sure nature would
have provided it water however should be given regularly
how frequently should an infant be nursed during the first week
after the third day every two hours during the day and twice during
the night the frequency during the rest of the first year is given in
the following table

how long should the child be kept at the breast for one nursing
not over twenty minutes
should the child take both breasts at one nursing
if the milk is very abundant one breast may be sufficient otherwise
both breasts may be taken
what are the important things to be attended to in nursing
first regularity it is just as important as in the case of
bottlefeeding secondly the nipples should be kept clean by being
washed after every nursing
what should be the diet of a nursing mother
she should have a simple but generous diet with plenty of fluids
three regular meals may be given and gruel milk or cocoa at bedtime
and sometimes between meals she may take eggs cereals most soups
and nearly all vegetables avoiding sour fruits salads pastry and
most desserts meat should not be taken more than twice daily and in
many cases but once she should take but little tea or coffee and
ordinarily no wine or beer
are fruits likely to disturb a nursing infant
sour fruits in some cases may do so but sweet fruits and most cooked
fruits are useful
what else is important in the life of the nursing mother
she should lead a simple natural life should have regular outofdoor
exercise preferably walking or driving as soon after her confinement
as her condition will permit she should have regular movements from
the bowels daily she should be as free as possible from unnecessary
cares and worry her rest at night should be disturbed as little as
possible she should lie down for at least one hour in the middle of
the day
does the nervous condition of the mother affect the milk
very much more than her diet worry anxiety fatigue loss of sleep
household cares social dissipation etc have more than anything else
to do with the failure of the modern mother as a nurse uncontrolled
emotions grief excitement fright passion may cause milk to
disagree with the child at times they may excite acute illness and
at other times they may cause a sudden and complete disappearance of
the milk
does menstruation affect the milk
in nearly all cases the quantity of milk is lessened so that the
infant is not satisfied and may gain less in weight or not at all in
many cases the quality of the milk is also affected to such a degree
as to cause slight disturbances of digestion such as restlessness
colic and perhaps some derangement of the bowels in a few attacks
of acute indigestion are excited
is regular menstruation a reason for stopping nursing
not invariably as a rule both functions do not go on together but if
the child is gaining regularly in weight between the periods nursing
may be continued indefinitely although it may be well to feed the
infant wholly or in part during the first day or two that the mother
is unwell
what symptoms indicate that a nursing infant is well nourished
the child has a good colour sleeps for two or three hours after
nursing or if awake is quiet goodnatured and apparently
comfortable it has normal movements of the bowels and gains steadily
in weight
what symptoms indicate that a child who is nursing is not properly
nourished
it does not gain and may even lose in weight it no longer exhibits
its usual energy and playfulness but is either listless and
indifferent or cross fretful and irritable and is apt to sleep
poorly it grows pale and anmic and its tissues become soft and
flabby when the milk is scanty it will often nurse a long time at the
breasts sometimes three quarters of an hour before stopping at
other times it may take the breast for a moment only and then turn
away in apparent disgust
what should be done when such symptoms appear
this depends upon the severity of the symptoms and how long they have
lasted if the child has made no gain for three or four weeks or is
losing weight immediate weaning will probably be necessary in any
case other food in addition to the breast milk should be given at
once one may begin by alternating the nursing and the bottlefeeding
and increase the number of bottlefeedings as may be indicated by the
results
is there any objection to a baby being partly nursed and partly fed
none whatever it is often better from the outset to feed the baby
during the night in order not to disturb the mothers rest
what symptoms indicate that the mothers milk disagrees with the
child
the child suffers from almost constant discomfort sleeps little and
then restlessly cries a great deal belches gas from the stomach and
passes much by the bowels or if not passed the gas accumulates and
causes abdominal distention and colicky pain there may be vomiting
but more often the trouble is intestinal sometimes the bowels are
constipated but usually the movements are frequent loose green
contain mucus and are passed with much gas
what should be done under these circumstances
if the symptoms have persisted for two or three weeks and the child is
not gaining in weight there is little chance of improvement and the
child should be taken from the breast at once if there is some gain
in weight one may try for a little longer endeavouring to improve
the mothers milk by rest fresh air careful diet etc however one
should always realize that the trouble is with the milk not with the
child
what changes should be made if a nursing infant habitually vomits
if this occurs soon after nursing the infant has usually taken too
much and the time of nursing should be shortened or one breast may be
given instead of two the nursing should also be interrupted by
occasional rests so that the milk is not taken too fast
if the vomiting occurs some time after nursing and is repeated it is
a sign of indigestion often because the milk is too rich in fat the
intervals between nursings should then be lengthened the breast milk
may be diluted by giving one or two tablespoonfuls of plain boiled
water limewater or barleywater five or ten minutes before
nursing the mother should eat less hearty food especially less meat
what should be done if the infant has frequent or habitual colic
this is usually because the milk is too rich in proteids the mother
should take more outofdoor exercise eat less meat and seek to
control her emotions all causes of worry should be removed
can constipation in a nursing infant be controlled through the
mothers milk
only to a limited extent it is important that the mothers bowels be
regular and her digestion good an increase in the meat and milk of
her diet is sometimes beneficial
weaning
at what age should the child be weaned from the breast
usually weaning should be begun at nine or ten months by substituting
one feeding a day for one nursing later two feedings and thus
gradually the child is to be taken from the breast altogether
what is the principal reason for weaning earlier
the most important one is that the child is not thrivingnot gaining
in weight and not progressing normally in its development serious
illness of the mother or pregnancy may make weaning necessary
at what age should the weaning be completed
generally at one year in summer it may sometimes be advisable to
nurse an infant a little longer rather than wean in warm weather but
even then the dangers of weaning are much less than those of
continuing to nurse as is so often done after the milk has become
very scanty and poor in quality
when should a child who is weaned from the breast be taught to drink
from the cup and when to take the bottle
if weaning is done as early as the eighth or ninth month it is better
to give the bottle if from the tenth to the twelfth month the infant
should be taught to drink or be fed with a spoon
how may some of the difficulties in weaning be overcome
by feeding every nursing infant once a day or by giving it water
regularly from a feedingbottle it then becomes accustomed to the
bottle this is a matter of great convenience during the whole period
of nursing when the mother or nurse is from necessity away from the
child for a few hours when more feeding is required at weaning time
the child does not object
when should a child be weaned from the bottle
with children who are not ill weaning from the bottle should
invariably be begun at the end of the first year and after a child is
thirteen or fourteen months old the bottle should not be given except
at the night feeding
is there any objection to the childs taking the bottle until it is
two or three years old
there are no advantages and some serious objections older children
often become so attached to the bottle that only with the greatest
difficulty can they be made to give it up frequently they will refuse
all solid food and will take nothing except from the bottle so long
as it is given and when finally at three or four years it is taken
away they will not touch milk during the rest of their childhood the
difficulty is here that children form the bottle habit this habit
is troublesome unnecessary and should by all means be prevented an
exclusive diet of milk for children of two or three years often
results in anmia and malnutrition
how should one train a child to do without the bottle
this is usually very easy if it is begun at one year the milk should
be poured into a tiny glass or cup and little by little the child is
taught to drink at first only a small portion of the food is taken in
this way the balance being given from the bottle but in the course
of a few weeks the average infant learns to drink from a cup without
difficulty and all the food can be so given
if the child is two or more years old the only effective means of
weaning from the bottle is through hunger the bottle should be taken
away at once and entirely and nothing allowed except milk from a cup
until the child takes this willingly sometimes a child will go an
entire day without food occasionally as long as two days but one
should not be alarmed on this account and yield this is a matter of
the childs will and not of his digestion and when once he has been
conquered it is seldom that any further trouble is experienced as
soon as a child has learned to drink his milk from a cup cereals and
other solid foods may gradually be added to the diet the educational
value of such training is not the least important consideration
can a baby just weaned take cows milk of the same proportions as one
of the same age who has had cows milk from birth
very rarely to give a baby who has had nothing but the breast from
birth plain cows milk or even that milk which a bottlefed baby of
the same age might take is almost certain to cause indigestion the
change in the food is quite a marked one and should be made gradually
by beginning with a very weak milk and increasing its strength as the
baby becomes accustomed to take cows milk
what would be the proper proportions for an infant weaned at four or
five months
about the same as for a healthy bottlefed infant of two months the
quantity of course should be larger the food can in most cases be
gradually increased so that in two or three weeks the usual strength
for the age can be taken
what would be the proper proportions for an infant weaned at nine or
ten months
about the same as for a bottlefed infant at four or five months to
be increased as indicated above
will not a child lose in weight when placed upon so low a diet
very often it will do so for the first week or two but after that
will gain quite regularly the acute indigestion however which
generally accompanies the use of stronger milk will in most cases
cause a greater loss
artificial feeding
what foods contain all the elements present in mothers milk
the milk of other animalscows milk being the only one which is
available for general use
is it not possible for infants to thrive upon other foods than those
containing fresh milk
they may do so for a time but never permanently the longcontinued
use of other foods as the sole diet is attended with great risk
what are the dangers of such foods
frequently scurvy is produced see page 141 often rickets and in
other cases simply a condition of general malnutritionthe child
does not thrive is pale and its muscles are soft and flabby
the selection and care of milk used for infant feeding
what are the essential points in milk selected for the feeding of
infants
that it comes from healthy cows and that it is clean and fresh
is it not important to select a rich milk
by no means in fact the very rich milk of highly bred jerseys and
alderneys has not been found nearly so satisfactory in infant feeding
as that from some other herds such for example as the common grade
cows
which is the better milk from one cow or the mixed milk of several
cows
the mixed or herd milk is usually to be preferred since it varies
little from day to day while that from a single cow may vary
considerably
how fresh is it important that cows milk should be for the best
results in infant feeding
this depends very much upon the season and how carefully milk is
handled as ordinarily handled at the dairy and in the home milk
should not be used for infants in winter after it is fortyeight hours
old in summer not after it is twentyfour hours old and it may be
unsafe in a much shorter time when handled with especial care milk
may be safe for a longer time
what are the two essentials in handling milk
1 that it be kept clean and free from contamination this
necessitates that cows stables and milkers be clean and that
transportation be in sealed bottles also that those who handle the
milk do not come in contact with any contagious disease all
milkpails bottles cans and other utensils with which the milk
comes in contact should be sterilized shortly before they are used
by steam or boiling water
2 that it be cooled immediately after leaving the cows and kept at
as low a temperature as possible to be efficient this should not be
above 50 f
milk produced under hygienic conditions and handled with special care
is sold in bottles in a number of cities under the name of
certified guaranteed or inspected milk when available such
milk should be used for infants of course the extra care bestowed in
its production and transportation increases the cost of the milk but
the best will usually be found in the end to be the cheapest
how should milk be handled in the home when obtained fresh from the
cows
that to be used for infants should be strained through a thick layer
of absorbent cotton or several thicknesses of cheesecloth into quart
glass jars or milk bottles which should be covered and cooled
immediately best by placing the bottles quite up to their necks in ice
water or cold spring water where they should stand for at least half
an hour that required for children who take plain milk may now be
poured into halfpint bottles stopped with cotton and put in the
icechest or the coolest place possible this first rapid cooling is
very important and adds much to the keeping qualities of the milk
milk loses its heat very quickly when cooled in water but very slowly
when it is simply placed in a cold room after standing four or five
hours the topmilk may be removed after twelve to sixteen hours the
cream may be removed
how should milk be handled when bottled milk is purchased
it should be cooled as just described as its temperature is usually
somewhat raised during transportation if it has been bottled at a
dairy the cream or the topmilk may be removed after an hour or so
how should milk and cream be handled when they are purchased in
bulk
such milk should never be used for infants when it is possible to
obtain bottled milk as it is much more liable to contamination both
cream and milk should be poured at once into covered vessels and kept
in the coolest place possible the cream and topmilk will seldom rise
upon such milk with any satisfactory regularity
what are the important things to be secured in nursery
refrigerators
absolute cleanliness is essential hence the inner portion should be
of metal those made entirely of metal are unsatisfactory as in them
the ice melts very quickly if the ordinary metal refrigerator sold is
encased in a wooden box we have the best form another easy way of
securing the same result is to make for the refrigerator a covering or
cosey of felt or heavy quilting which can be easily removed when
wet or soiled
the compartments of the refrigerator should be so arranged that the
bottles of milk are either in contact with the ice or very near it
the supply of ice should be abundant often the amount of ice is so
small and the bottles so far away that the temperature of the milk
is never below 60 or 65 f to be really effective a refrigerator
should have a temperature where the milk is placed of not over 50 f
the temperature should be tested with the nursery thermometer from
time to time to ascertain what results are being obtained spoiled
milk owing to a faulty refrigerator is to be blamed for many attacks
of acute illness among infants next to the feedingbottles it is the
one thing in the nursery which should receive the closest attention
the modification of cows milk
can cows milk be fed to infants without any changes
no for although it contains similar elements to those in mothers
milk they are not identical and they are not present in the same
proportions
is this a matter of much importance
it is of the greatest importance there are few infants who can digest
cows milk unless it is changed to change cows milk so as to make it
more nearly resemble mothers milk is called modifying cows milk
how is this milk whose proportions have been changed distinguished
from the original unchanged milk
the changed milk is usually called modified milk the original
unchanged milk is known as plain milk whole milk straight
milk or is referred to simply as milk
what are the principal differences between cows milk and mothers
milk
cows milk has a little more than half as much sugar it has nearly
three times as much proteids and salts its proteids are different and
much more difficult of digestion its reaction is decidedly acid that
of mothers milk is faintly acid or neutral
are there any other important things to be considered
yes mothers milk is always fed fresh and is practically sterile
cows milk is generally kept twentyfour hours and sometimes much
longer it is always to a greater or less degree contaminated by dirt
and germs the number of which increases rapidly 1 with the age of
the milk 2 in proportion to amount of the dust or dirt which enters
it 3 with any increase in the temperature at which the milk is
kept
it is just as important for success in infant feeding that these
conditions receive attention as that the proportions of the different
elements of the milk are right
how is the acidity of cows milk overcome
by the addition of limewater or bicarbonate of soda if limewater is
used one ounce to twenty ounces of food is generally required if
soda is used twenty grains to twenty ounces of food
if there is a tendency to constipation the milk of magnesia
phillipss may be used from one half to one teaspoonful being added
to each twenty ounces of food
how is the sugar best increased
by adding milk sugar to the food one ounce to each twenty ounces of
food will give the proper quantity for the first three or four months
this will make the proportion about the same between 6 and 7 per
cent as in mothers milk
how should the sugar be prepared
simply dissolved in boiled water if the solution is not clear or if
there is a deposit after standing it should be filtered by pouring
through a layer of absorbent cotton half an inch thick which is
placed in an ordinary funnel
will not cane granulated sugar answer as well
not as a rule however there are many infants who get on very well
when cane sugar is used it has the advantage of being much cheaper a
good grade of milk sugar is somewhat expensive costing from
twentyfive to sixty cents a pound and cheap samples are apt to
contain impurities
if cane sugar is used what amount should be added
considerably less than of the milk sugar usually about half the
quantity half an ounce to twenty ounces of food is as much as most
infants can digest if the same quantity is used as of the milk sugar
the food is made unduly sweet and the sugar is likely to ferment in
the stomach and cause colic
is not the purpose of the sugar to sweeten the food in order to make
it palatable
not at all although it does that its real use is to furnish one of
the essential elements needed for the growth of the body and the one
that is required by young infants in the largest quantity
how do we know that this is so
by the fact that in good breast milk the amount of sugar is greater
than that of the fat proteids and salts combined
we have seen that cows milk has nearly three times as much proteids
curd and salts as mothers milk how are these to be diminished
by diluting the milk
will it be sufficient to dilute the milk twice ie add two parts
of water to one part of milk
not for a very young infant although this will give about the
quantity of proteids present in mothers milk the proteids of cows
milk are so much more difficult for the infant to digest that in the
beginning it should be diluted five or six times for most infants
if cows milk is properly diluted and limewater and sugar added does
it then resemble mothers milk
no the mixture contains too little fat
what is the easiest way of overcoming this
by increasing the fat in the milk before dilution it may be done by
using topmilk or a mixture of milk and cream
what is topmilk
it is the upper layer of milk removed after standing a certain number
of hours in a milk bottle glass jar or any tall vessel with straight
sides it contains most of the cream and some of the milk just below
the strength of the topmilk is measured by the fat it containseg
a 10percent milk contains 10 per cent fat 7percent milk contains
7 per cent fat etc these are the two strengths of top milk most used
in infant feeding
on what does the percentage of fat in topmilk depend
1 on the length of time the milk has stood
2 on the manner in which the topmilk is removed
3 on the number of ounces removed
4 on the richness of the milk used
unless these are known it is impossible to say even approximately how
strong in fat the topmilk is
when and how should topmilk be removed
if milk fresh from the cow or before the cream has risen is put into
bottles and rapidly cooled the topmilk may be removed in as short a
time as four hours in the case of bottled milk it makes little
difference if it stands a longer time even until the next day the
best means of removing it is by a small creamdipper2 holding one
ounce although it may be taken off by a spoon or siphon it should
not be poured off
    2 obtained from any of the walkergordon milk laboratories
    from james dougherty no 411 west 59th street new york and
    from many druggists price 20 cents
how can we obtain a 10percent topmilk with the different kinds of
cows milk
from a rather poor milk containing 3312 per cent fat by removing
the upper eight ounces from a quart or one fourth
from a good average milk containing 4 per cent fat by removing the
upper eleven ounces from a quart or about one third
from a rich jersey milk containing 5512 per cent fat by removing
the upper sixteen ounces or one half
how can we obtain a 7percent topmilk with the different kinds of
cows milk
from a rather poor milk by removing the upper eleven ounces from a
quart about one third
from a good average milk by removing the upper sixteen ounces or one
half
from a rich jersey milk by removing the upper twentytwo ounces or
about two thirds
illustration the percentage of fat in the different layers of milk
of good average quality
what is cream
cream is often spoken of as if it were the fat in milk it is really
the part of the milk which contains most of the fat it differs from
milk chiefly in containing much more fat
in what ways is cream now obtained
1 by skimming after the milk has stood usually for twentyfour
hours this is known as gravity cream 2 by an apparatus known as
a separator this is known as centrifugal cream most of the cream
now sold in cities is of this kind the richness of any cream is
indicated by the amount of fat it contains
the usual gravity cream sold has from 16 to 20 per cent fat the cream
removed from the upper part one fifth of a bottle of milk has about
16 per cent fat the usual centrifugal cream has 18 to 20 per cent
fat the heavy centrifugal cream has 35 to 40 per cent fat
food for healthy infants3the early months
    3 the directions and formulas given in the following pages
    are intended only for guidance in feeding children who
    are not suffering from any special disturbance of digestion
    directions for such conditions are given in a later chapter
what are the most important points to be remembered in modifying
cows milk for feeding during the early months
that of the different ingredients of milk the sugar is most easily
digested the fat is next while the proteids are the most difficult
what relation should the fat bear to the proteids during this
period
for most infants with good digestion the best results are obtained
when the fat is three times the proteids however this is not true of
all there are many healthy infants who are unable to digest this
proportion of fat and who do much better when the fat is made only
twice the proteids
how can one obtain formulas in which the fat is three times the
proteids
by using for dilution a 10percent milk ie milk containing 10 per
cent fat which serves as the primary formula from which all the other
formulas of this series are derived
in 10percent milk the fat is just three times the proteids
how can one get the 10percent milk
1 as topmilk as described on page 64 or 2 by mixing equal
parts of plain milk and ordinary cream containing about 16 per cent
fat 3 from any of the milk laboratories it may be ordered
directly
is it better to obtain the 10percent milk by using a mixture of
milk and cream or as topmilk
if one can get milk fresh from the cows the topmilk is to be
preferred on account of freshness the food can then be made up when
the milk is but a few hours old in cities if one uses bottled milk
the upper third may also be used but if one buys milk and cream
separately it is usually more convenient to mix these as the cream
will not rise upon milk a second time with any uniformity
how can one obtain formulas in which the fat is twice the
proteids
by using for dilution a 7percent milk ie milk containing 7 per
cent fat which serves as the primary formula from which all the other
formulas of this series are derived
in 7percent milk the fat is just twice the proteids
how can one get the 7percent milk
1 as topmilk as described on page 64 or 2 by mixing three
parts of milk and one part of ordinary 16 per cent cream 3 from
any of the milk laboratories it may be obtained directly as in the
case of 10percent milk the topmilk is generally to be preferred to
a mixture of milk and cream
how should the food be prepared during the early months
it is convenient in calculation to make up twenty ounces of food at a
time the first step is to obtain the 10percent milk or the
7percent milk to be used as the primary formula then to take the
number of ounces of this that are called for in the formula desired
noteone should not make the mistake of taking from the top of the
bottle only the number of ounces needed in the formula as this may
give quite a different result
there will be required in addition one ounce of milk sugar4 and one
ounce of limewater in each twenty ounces the rest of the food will
be made up of boiled water
    4 if the milk sugar be measured in the milkdipper two scant
    dipperfuls may be calculated as one ounce if measured in a
    tablespoon three even tablespoonfuls may be calculated as one
    ounce
these formulas written out would be as follows

will be exactly twenty ounces the food is strengthened by gradually

how is one to decide whether to use the first or the second series of
formulas
with a large strong child having a good digestion one should use the
first series with a smaller less vigorous child whose digestion is
not so good or with one who does not do well upon the first series
the second series should be used
why is it necessary to make the food so weak at first
because the infants stomach is intended to digest breast milk not
cows milk but if we begin with a very weak cows milk the stomach
can be gradually trained to digest it if we began with a strong milk
the digestion might be seriously upset
how rapidly can the food be increased in strength from formula i to
ii from ii to iii etc
no absolute rule can be given usually we begin with i on the second
day ii on the fourth day iii at one week or ten days but after that
make the increase more slowly a large infant with a strong digestion
will bear a rather rapid increase and may be able to take v by the
time it is three or four weeks old a child with a feeble digestion
must go much slower and may not reach v before it is three or four
months old
it is important with all children that the increase in the food be
made very gradually it may be best with many infants to increase the
milk by only half an ounce in twenty ounces of food instead of one
ounce at a time as indicated in the tables thus from 3 ounces the
increase would be to 312 ounces from 4 ounces to 412 ounces etc at
least two or three days should be allowed between each increase in the
strength of the food
what general rule can be given for increasing the food
to increase when the infant is not satisfied but is digesting well
how does an infant show that he is not satisfied
he drains the bottle eagerly and cries when it is taken away he often
forms the habit of sucking his fingers immediately after he begins to
fret half an hour or an hour before the next feeding is due
in the series of formulas given in the table the quantities are
mentioned for making only twenty ounces of food how should it be
prepared when more than this quantity is needed
it is equally convenient to make up 25 ounces 30 ounces 35 ounces
or 40 ounces at a time
  to make
  25 ounces of any formula add one quarter more of each ingredient
  30                         one half                    
  35                         three quarters              
  40                         twice as much               
thus 25 ounces of formula i would be obtained by using 212 ounces of
milk 114 ounces of sugar and limewater 2114 ounces of water 30
ounces of the same would require 3 ounces milk 112 ounces limewater
and sugar and 2512 ounces water 35 ounces would require 312 ounces
milk 134 ounces limewater and sugar and 2934 ounces water the amount
of water need not be calculated in any case but after measuring
carefully the other ingredients enough water should be added to bring
the total up to the amount required
how great an increase in the quantity should be made at one time
one may make up five ounces additional food but the first two days
only two or three ounces of the additional amount should be given the
next two days four ounces after two days more the five ounces may
be given
the increase in the quantity given at a single feeding should not be
more than a quarter of an ounce
food for healthy infantsthe later months
how long should the fat be as much as three times the proteids
this is seldom of advantage longer than three or four months
what changes should then be made in the milk
after formula v of the first series 6 ounces of 10percent milk in
20 ounces of food has been reached the fat should be increased very
slowly for this proportion 3 per cent is near the limit for most
healthy children the milk should now be strengthened chiefly by
raising the percentage of proteids
how is this accomplished
the 10percent milk and the formulas derived from it should now be
discontinued and those made from 7percent milk used
  third series
  formulas for the later months from 7percent milk
  
                       i      ii     iii    iv     v
  
  7percent milk      7 oz   8 oz   9 oz  10 oz   11 oz
  milk sugar           1      1      1      34     12 
  limewater           1      1      1      1       1   
  boiled water        12      11    10      4       3   
  barley gruel         0      0      0      5       5   
  
                      20 oz  20 oz  20 oz  20 oz   20 oz
  
since the sugar dissolves the total will be twenty ounces in each
column
of any of the formulas 25 ounces is made by using one quarter more
of each ingredient 30 ounces by using one half more 35 ounces by
using three quarters more 40 ounces by using twice as much exactly
as described in the first series on page 73
the approximate composition of these formulas expressed in percentages
is as follows
  
  formula   fat     sugar     proteids
  
    i       250     650       125
   ii       280     650       140
  iii       315     700       155
   iv       350     600       175
    v       400     600       200

how should the food be increased during this period
beginning with i of this series which should usually follow v of the
first or second series pages 70 71 the increase may generally be
made in a week or ten days to ii in about two weeks more to iii now
more slowly to iv and v when iv or v has been reached the same
formula may sometimes be continued for three or four months with no
other change than an increase in the quantity
in passing from formula v of the first series to formula i of the
third series the proportion of fat is at first reduced is this
necessary or important
no it only happens to come so in simplifying the calculation it may
be avoided by taking off at first the upper 13 ounces as topmilk and
using 7 ounces of this in a 20ounce mixture in place of formula i
and by using for the next increase the upper 15 ounces as topmilk
taking of this 8 ounces in a 20ounce mixture in place of formula ii
then should follow formula iii
what further addition may be made to the food of the later months
usually about the sixth or seventh month farinaceous food in the form
of gruel may be added this taking the place of part of the water and
part of the sugar
what changes may be made in the food when the infant has reached the
age of ten or eleven months
the proteids may be still further increased and the sugar and the
limewater reduced until plain milk is given
how may this best be done
at first one feeding a day of plain milk and barley gruel may be
given later two feedings then three feedings etc let us suppose
an infant to be taking such a modified milk as formula iv or v page
76 six feedings a day the plain milk diluted only with barley gruel
would at first replace one of these feedings then two three four
etc these changes being made at intervals of about two weeks the
proportions of the milk and barley gruel should at first be about
512 ounces milk 212 ounces barley later 6 ounces milk 3 ounces
barley still later 7 ounces milk 2 ounces barley until finally
plain milk is given to drink and the cereals given separately with a
spoon this is reached with most infants at fourteen or fifteen
months with many at twelve or thirteen months other forms of
farinaceous food may of course be used in the place of the barley and
in the same proportions
with some infants the addition of a pinch of bicarbonate of soda may
be advantageously made to each milkfeeding when the limewater is
omitted but with most this is unnecessary
if the infant strongly objects to the taste of the milk when the milk
sugar has been omitted a small quantity one fourth to one half
teaspoonful of granulated sugar may for a time be added to each
feeding then gradually reduced
general rules for guidance in the use of the formulas given
it should again be emphasized that these formulas are not intended for
sick children nor for those suffering from any marked symptoms of
indigestion for such infants special rules are given later
what should be the guide in deciding upon a formula with which to
begin for a child who is to be artificially fed
the age and the weight are of some importance but the best guide is
the condition of the childs digestive organs one should always begin
with a weak formula particularly 1 with an infant previously
breast fed 2 with one just weaned as a child who has never had
cows milk must at first have weaker proportions than the age and the
weight would seem to indicate 3 with infants whose power of
digestion is unknown if the first formula tried is weaker than the
child can digest the food can be strengthened every three or four
days until it is found what the child is able to take on the
contrary if the food is made too strong at first an attack of
indigestion will probably follow
how should the food be increased in strength
the first essential is that it be done very gradually abruptly
increasing the food usually causes a disturbance of digestion
it is never wise to advance more rapidly in strengthening the food
than from one formula to the next one in any of the series given with
many infants it is better to make the steps of increase only half as
great as those indicated page 72
how rapidly should the food be increased in quantity
the increase should not be more than a quarter of an ounce in each
feeding or from one and a half to two ounces in a day
when should the food be increased
in the early weeks an increase may be necessary every few days in the
later months sometimes the same formula may be continued for two or
three months it is however impossible to give a definite rule as to
time one cannot say with any child that an increase is to be made
every week or every two weeks a much better guide are the conditions
present
the signs indicating that the food should be increased are that the
infant is not satisfied not gaining in weight but is digesting well
ie not vomiting and having good stools one should not increase
the food however so long as the child seems perfectly satisfied and
is gaining from four to six ounces a week even though both the
quantity and the strength of the food are considerably below the
average nor should the food be increased if the child is gaining from
eight to ten ounces a week even if he seems somewhat hungry the
appetite is not always a safe guide to follow
how can one know whether the strength or the quantity of the food
should be increased
in the early weeks it is well first to increase the strength of the
food the next time to increase the quantity then the strength again
etc after the fourth or fifth month the quantity chiefly should be
increased
if a slight disturbance or discomfort occurs after the food has been
strengthened is it best to go back to the weaker formula or to
persist with the new one
symptoms of minor discomfort are seen for a day or two with many
infants after an ordinary increase in food but in most cases an
infant soon becomes accustomed to the stronger food and is able to
digest it if however the symptoms of disturbance are marked one
should promptly go back to the weaker formula the next increase
should be a smaller one
should one be disturbed if for the first two or three weeks of
artificial feeding the gain in weight is very slight or even if there
is none
not as a rule if the infant does not lose weight is perfectly
comfortable sleeps most of the time and does not suffer from any
symptoms of indigestion such as colic vomiting etc one may be
sure that all is going well and that the infant is becoming used to
his new food as the childs appetite improves and his digestion is
stronger the food may be increased every few days and very soon the
gain in weight will come and will then be continuous if however the
scales are watched too closely and because there is only a slight
gain in weight or none at all the food is rapidly increased an acute
disturbance of digestion is pretty certain to follow
is not constipation likely to occur if the child is on a very weak
food
it is very often seen and is due simply to the small amount of residue
in the intestine under these circumstances if the bowels move once
every day one should not be disturbed even when the movements are
small and somewhat dry as the food is gradually strengthened this
constipation soon passes off while if injections suppositories or
cathartics are used to produce freer movements the functions of the
bowels are likely to be disturbed
under what circumstances should the food be reduced
whenever the child becomes ill from any cause whatever or whenever
any marked symptoms of indigestion arise
how may this be done
if the disturbance is only a moderate one and the food has been made
up for the day one third may be poured off from the top of each
bottle just before it is given and this quantity of food replaced by
the same amount of boiled water
if the disturbance is more severe the food should be immediately
diluted by at least one half and at the same time the quantity given
should be reduced
for a severe acute attack of indigestion the regular food should be
omitted altogether and only water given until the doctor has been
called
if the food has been reduced for a disturbance of digestion how
should one return to the original formula
while the reduction of the food should be immediate and considerable
the increase should be very gradual after a serious attack of acute
indigestion when beginning with milk again it should not be made
more than one fifth the original strength and from ten days to two
weeks should pass before the child is brought back to his original
food which should be done very gradually it is surprising how long a
time is required with young infants before they completely recover
from an attack of acute indigestion even though it did not seem to be
very severe the second disturbance always comes from a slighter cause
than the first one
the addition of other foods to milk
how long should modified milk be continued without the addition of
other food
this depends upon circumstances usually for about six months but if
the infant is thriving satisfactorily the milk may be used alone for
ten or eleven months with some infants who have especial difficulty
in digesting cows milk it is advisable to begin the use of other
food at three or four months or even from the outset
what is the first thing to be used with milk
farinaceous food in some form usually as a gruel
how are these gruels made
they may be made directly from the grains or from some of the prepared
flours page 149 the flours are usually to be preferred as being
more simple of preparation
how should they be used in making the food
they should be cooked separately rather than with the milk when the
food is mixed they take the place of a portion of the water in the
formulas given on pages 70 and 71
how much of the gruel should be used
if it is prepared as recommended on page 149 it may make according to
circumstances from one sixth to one half the total quantity of food
which of the farinaceous foods are to be preferred
those most used are barley oatmeal arrowroot and farina there is
not much difference in their nutritive value oatmeal gruel is
somewhat more laxative
what value do these substances possess as infant foods
some of the starch is digested and absorbed but the chief value of
gruels is believed to be that when added to milk they render the curd
more easily digested by preventing it from coagulating in the stomach
in large tough masses this is certainly true with many infants but
there are others who are not at all benefited and not a few young
infants whose digestion is made distinctly worse by the use of
farinaceous food particularly when employed in considerable quantity
the addition of gruels to milk for all infants is not to be
recommended
what further additions may be made to the diet of healthy infants
during the first year
beef juice the white of egg and orange juice
how and when may beef juice be used
with infants who are strong and thriving satisfactorily it may be
begun at ten or eleven months two teaspoonfuls may be given daily
diluted with the same quantity of water fifteen minutes before the
midday feeding in two weeks the quantity may be doubled and in four
weeks six teaspoonfuls may be given the maximum quantity at one year
should not be more than two or three tablespoonfuls
with delicate infants who are pale and anmic beef juice is more
important and it may often be wisely begun at five or six months in
half the quantities mentioned
when should white of egg be used
under the same conditions as beef juice particularly with infants who
have difficulty in digesting the proteins curd of milk at six
months half the white of one egg may be given at one time and soon
after this the entire white of one egg the best in manner of cooking
is the coddled egg see page 151
when should orange juice be begun
usually about the eleventh or twelfth month it should be given about
one hour before the feeding two teaspoonfuls at first then one
tablespoonful at a time and later three or four tablespoonfuls it is
particularly useful when there is constipation it should always be
strained and care should be taken that it is sweet and fresh
overfeeding
what is meant by overfeeding
giving an infant too much food either too much at one time or too
frequently overfeeding is sometimes practised during the day but is
chiefly done at night
is not an infants natural desire for food a proper guide as to the
quantity given
the appetite of a perfectly normal infant usually is but overeating
is a habit gradually acquired and may continue until twice as much
food as is proper is taken in the twentyfour hours this habit is
most frequently seen in infants whose digestion is not quite normal
because of the temporary relief from discomfort experienced by taking
food into the stomach they often appear to be hungry the greater part
of the time especially at night
what are the causes of overfeeding
the most common one is the habit of watching the weight too closely
and the conviction on the part of the mother or nurse that because a
child is not so large nor gaining so rapidly as some other infant of
the same age more food or stronger food should be given
what harm results from overfeeding
all food taken in excess of what a child can digest becomes a burden
to him the food lies in the stomach or bowels undigested ferments
and causes wind and colic when overfeeding is longer continued
serious disturbances of digestion are soon produced the infant is
restless fretful constantly uncomfortable sleeps badly and stops
gaining and may even lose in weight such symptoms may lead to the
mistaken conclusion that too little food is given and it is
accordingly increased when it should be diminished one of the
results of longcontinued overfeeding is dilatation or stretching of
the stomach
what should guide one as to the quantity of food to be given to any
infant
1 the size of the infants stomach at the different months 2 the
amount of milk which the healthy nursing infant gets 3 the
quantities with which most children do best the table of quantities
and intervals of feeding on page 108 gives the average figures
derived from these sources it is seldom wise to go beyond the limits
there stated nor should one insist upon giving any fixed amount if it
is clearly more than the child wants or can be made to take except by
continued coaxing
loss of appetite
what is to be done when without any other signs of illness a childs
appetite gradually fails
this is often the result of a long period of overfeeding or the use of
milk too rich in fat if in all other respects the child seems well
and simply does not want his food it should be offered at regular
hours but not more frequently on no account should he be coaxed
much less forced to eat even though he takes only one half or one
third the usual quantity the intervals between feedings should not be
shortened but rather lengthened often with a child a year old it is
necessary to reduce the number of feedings to four or even three in
twentyfour hours water however may be offered at more frequent
intervals the food should be weakened rather than strengthened no
greater mistake can be made than because so little is taken coaxing
or forcing food at short intervals through fear lest the child may
lose weight
the changes in the food required by special symptoms or conditions
infants with weak digestion and those suffering from various forms of
indigestion have often especial trouble in digesting the fat of milk
to meet the needs of such there is required a series of formulas in
which the fat is lower than in those already given
these formulas are obtained from plain milk
  fourth series
  formulas from plain milk containing 4percent fat
  
                i   ii  iii iv  v    vi   vii   viii

               oz  oz  oz  oz  oz    oz   oz    oz
    
when larger quantities than 20 ounces are required they are calculated
in the same manner as described on page 73 in speaking of 10percent
milk
the approximate composition of the formulas of the fourth series
expressed in percentages is as follows
  
  formula   fat     sugar     proteids
  
     i      100     600       090
    ii      120     600       100
   iii      140     650       120
    iv      160     650       140
     v      180     600       160
    vi      200     600       180

  viii      280     550       250
  
why is it that an infant so often vomits some of its food within a
few moments after finishing its bottle
usually because the quantity is too large sometimes it is due to the
fact that the food is taken too rapidly from too large a hole in the
nipple it may be due to too tight clothing or to moving the child
about in such a way as to press upon the stomach
what are the principal causes of and the changes in the food
required by habitual vomiting regurgitation or spitting up of small
quantities of food between feedings often repeated many times a day
this is always a symptom of gastric indigestion and a most
troublesome one in such conditions the fat and often the sugar also
should be reduced and the limewater increased
formulas made from rich topmilk or milk and cream are to be avoided
those made from 7percent milk are less likely to be the cause of
trouble than those from 10percent milk but if the symptoms are at
all severe it is better to use instead of these the formulas of the
fourth series derived from plain milk
reduction in the sugar may be made by adding only one half ounce of
milk sugar to each twenty ounces of the food in severe cases the
sugar may be omitted altogether
it is often advisable to double the amount of limewaterie use
two ounces to each twenty ounces of food
the malted foods and all other foods containing much sugar usually
aggravate the symptoms
the intervals between meals should generally be half an hour longer
and sometimes an hour longer than when digestion is normal
the quantity given at a feeding should generally be less than with a
normal digestion usually a smaller quantity of a strong food succeeds
better than a larger quantity of a weak food
what are the causes of and food changes required by a constant and
excessive formation of gas in the stomach leading to distention and
pain or eructations belching of gas and often of a sour watery
fluid
this is often associated with habitual vomiting and is due to similar
causes but particularly to the sugar which should be greatly reduced
or omitted entirely
what changes should be made when there is habitual colic
this is generally due to an accumulation of gas in the intestines
which forms there because the proteids curd of the milk are not
digested they should be reduced by using in the early months a weaker
formulaie instead of formula v of the first or second series iv
might be used or for a short time even iii the proteids may be
reduced in the middle period by using weaker formulas if we desire to
reduce the proteids without reducing the fat we may change from the
second to the first series
another means of relieving habitual colic is the use of partially
peptonized milk page 115 still another the dilution with
barleywater instead of plain water
what change should be made if curds appear in the stools regularly or
frequently
this is usually associated with habitual colic and has to be managed
exactly like that condition by the means just described
how should the milk be modified for chronic constipation
the constipation of the first weeks of life has been already referred
to page 82 it usually disappears as the food is gradually
strengthened in all its proportions
habitual constipation at a later period is difficult to overcome by
diet alone it sometimes depends upon the fact that the proteids are
too high and sometimes that the fat is too low hence it is more
frequent when infants are fed upon plain milk variously diluted page
90 then when 7percent or 10percent milk is used and diluted to
a greater degree but it is not desirable to use a topmilk containing
more than ten per cent fat for this purpose nor is it wise to carry
the fat in the food above 4 per cent ie 8 ounces of 10percent
milk or 12 ounces of 7percent milk in a 20ounce mixture or other
disturbances of digestion may be produced
in some cases the use in place of milk sugar of ordinary brown
sugar in half the quantity is of assistance or of some of the
malted foods mellins food malted milk cereal milk also in the
place of milk sugar
the substitution of the milk of magnesia for the limewater as
recommended on page 60 will often be found useful
to infants over nine months old orange juice may be given
what special modifications are required during very hot weather
during the warm season it is well to make the proportion of fat less
than during cold weather during short periods of excessive heat it
should be much less the fat is reduced by using 7percent milk in
place of 10percent ie the second instead of the first series of
formulas page 71 or plain milk in place of the 7percent milk in
the second and third series page 90 at such times also the usual
food should be diluted and water should be given freely between the
feedings
what changes should be made in the food of a child who with all the
signs of good digestion gains very little or not at all in weight
if the child seems hungry the quantity of food may be increased but
if the child will not readily take any more in quantity the strength
may be increased by the use of the next higher formula one should
however be extremely careful under these circumstances not to coax or
force a child for this plan is almost certain to cause disturbance of
digestion and actual loss in weight a better policy is that of
looking after the other factors in the childs lifethe care sleep
fresh air etc for with these rather than with the food the trouble
often lies
what should be done with infants who in spite of all variations in
the milk continue to have symptoms of indigestion and do not thrive
except inmates of institutions who form a class by themselves most
infants who receive proper care thrive upon milk if the proportions
suited to the digestion are given still there are some who do not
the nutrition of such is always a matter of difficulty
if a wetnurse is available the employment of one is the thing most
likely to succeed particularly if the infant is under four or five
months old
if the infant is older or if a wetnurse cannot be obtained some of
the substitutes for fresh cows milk may be tried one of the best is
condensed milk bordens eagle brand canned being preferred this is
more likely to agree if the symptoms are chiefly intestinal colic
flatulence curds in the stools constipation or diarrhoea than if
they are chiefly gastric vomiting regurgitation etc
how should condensed milk be used
for an infant three or four months old with symptoms of indigestion
it should at first be diluted with 16 parts of boiled water or
sometimes preferably with barleywater with improvement in the
symptoms the dilution may be made 1 to 14 1 to 12 1 to 10 and 1 to
8 these changes being gradually made the intervals between feedings
and the quantities for one feeding are given on page 108
how long should condensed milk be continued
in most cases it should be used as the sole food for a few weeks only
afterward one feeding a day of a weak formula of modified milk eg
no iii or iv of the second series page 71 may be given later two
feedings and thus gradually the number of milk feedings is increased
until the child is taking only modified milk
condensed milk is not to be recommended as a permanent food where good
fresh cows milk can be obtained
what are the objections to its use
it is very low in fat and proteids and high in sugar this accounts
for its easy digestibility and also explains why children reared upon
it often gain very rapidly in weight yet have as a rule but little
resistance they are very prone to develop rickets and sometimes
scurvy
are the proprietary infant foods open to the same objections as
condensed milk
they are what has been said of condensed milk applies equally well to
most of those that are sold in the market as substitutes for milk
what changes in the food are required by slight indisposition
for slight general disturbances such as dentition colds sore
throats etc it is usually sufficient simply to dilute the food if
this is but for two or three feedings it is most easily done by
replacing with boiled water an ounce or two of the food removed from
the bottle just before it is given if for several days a weaker
formula should be used
what changes should be made for a serious acute illness
for such attacks as those of pneumonia bronchitis measles etc
attended with fever the food should be diluted and the fat reduced as
described on page 95 it should be given at regular intervals rather
less frequently than in health water should be given freely between
the feedings food should not be forced in the early days of an acute
illness since the loss of appetite usually means an inability to
digest much food
what immediate changes should be made in the food when the child is
taken with an acute attack of gastric indigestion with repeated
vomiting fever pain etc
all milk should be stopped at once and only boiled water given for
ten or twelve hours afterward barleywater or whey may be tried but
no milk for at least twentyfour hours after the vomiting has ceased
when beginning with modified milk the quantity should be small and the
fat low which may be secured by the use of the fourth series of
formulas in the place of the first or second series the proportion of
limewater may be doubled
what changes should be made for an attack of intestinal indigestion
attended by looseness of the bowels
if this is not severe only two or three passages daily the fat
should be lowered in the manner stated just above and the milk should
be boiled for five minutes if curds are present in the stools it may
be still further diluted
if the diarrhoeal attack is more severe and attended by fever and
foulsmelling movements of greater frequency all milk should be
stopped immediately and the diet mentioned just above under the head
of acute disturbances of the stomach should be employed
what changes in the food should be made when the child seems to have
very little appetite and yet is not ill
the number of feedings should be reduced the interval being
lengthened by one hour or even more no greater mistake can be made
than to offer food every hour or two to an infant who is not hungry
such a course only prolongs and aggravates the disturbance
what other conditions besides the food greatly influence the childs
digestion
proper clothing warm feet regular habits fresh air clean bottles
and food given at the proper temperature are all quite as important as
the preparation of the food quiet peaceful surroundings and absence
of excitement are also essential to good digestion
common mistakes in milk modification and infant feeding
i in using modifications made from topmilk much confusion arises
from the notion that topmilk is a single definite thing whereas its
composition depends upon a great variety of conditions and unless all
these are known it is impossible to tell how strong it is directions
for the removal of topmilk should be explicitly followed see page
63 or the results will be very different from those expected
ii in formulas calling for a certain number of ounces of topmilk of
any given strength the mistake is made of removing only the number of
ounces needed for the formula the proper way is to remove the amount
required to secure a topmilk of the desired strength and then to take
of this the number of ounces needed in the formula
iii a rich jersey milk is used as if it were ordinary milk the
formulas given in this book are chiefly calculated on the basis of a
good average milk which contains about 4 per cent fat many persons
have the idea that the richer the milk the more rapidly the child
will gain in weight and hence the superiority of such milk for infant
feeding while it is true that some children taking a very rich milk
may for a time gain rapidly in weight yet sooner or later serious
disturbances of digestion are nearly always produced
iv the food is increased too rapidly particularly after some
disturbance of digestion if in an infant three or four months old
an attack of somewhat acute indigestion occurs the food should seldom
be given in full strength before two weeks the increase in the diet
should be made very gradually the steps being made only one half
those indicated in the series of formulas on pages 70 and 71
otherwise it generally happens that the attack of indigestion is very
much prolonged and much loss in weight occurs
v when symptoms of indigestion occur the food is not reduced rapidly
enough indigestion usually means that the organs are for the time
unequal to the work imposed if the food is immediately reduced by one
half the organs of digestion soon regain their power and the
disturbance is short in every case the amount of reduction should
depend upon the degree of the disturbance
preparation of cows milk at home
what articles are required for the preparation of cows milk at
home
feedingbottles rubber nipples an eightounce graduated measuring
glass a glass or agate funnel bottle brush cotton alcohol lamp or
better a bunsen gas burner a tall quart cup for warming bottles of
milk a pitcher for mixing the food a widemouth bottle for boric
acid and one for bicarbonate of soda and a pasteurizer later a
double boiler for cooking cereals will be needed
what bottles are to be preferred
a cylindrical graduated bottle with a rather wide neck so as to admit
of easy washing and one which contains no angles or corners a single
size holding eight ounces is quite sufficient for use during the first
year all complicated bottles are bad being difficult to clean one
should have as many bottles in use as the child takes meals a day
how should bottles be cared for
as soon as they are emptied they should be rinsed with cold water and
allowed to stand filled with water to which a little bicarbonate of
soda has been added before the milk is put into them they should be
thoroughly washed with a bottle brush and hot soapsuds and then
placed for twenty minutes in boiling water
what sort of nipples should be used
only simple straight nipples which slip over the neck of the bottle
those with a rubber or glass tube are too complicated and very
difficult to keep clean nipples made of black rubber are to be
preferred the hole in the nipple should not be so large that the milk
will run in a stream but just large enough for it to drop rapidly
when the bottle with the nipple attached is inverted
how should nipples be cared for
new nipples should be boiled for five minutes but it is unnecessary
to repeat this every day as they soon become so soft as to be almost
useless after using nipples should be carefully rinsed in cold water
and kept in a covered glass containing a solution of borax or boric
acid at least once a day they should be turned wrong side out and
thoroughly washed with soap and water
what sort of cotton should be used
the refined nonabsorbent cotton is rather better for stoppering
bottles but the ordinary absorbent cotton will answer every purpose
which is better the bunsen burner or the alcohol lamp
if there is gas in the house the bunsen burner is greatly to be
preferred being cheaper simpler and much safer than the alcohol
lamp if the lamp is used it should stand upon a table covered with a
plate of zinc or tin or upon a large tin tray the french pattern of
alcohol lamp is the best
give the directions for preparing the food according to any of the
above formulas
the nurses hands bottles tables and all utensils should be
scrupulously clean first dissolve the milk sugar in boiling water
filtering if necessary then add the milk and cream and limewater
mixing the whole in a pitcher a sufficient quantity of food for
twentyfour hours is always to be prepared at one time this is then
divided into the number of feedings required for the day each feeding
being put in a separate bottle and the bottle stoppered with cotton
the bottles should then be cooled rapidly by standing first in tepid
then in cold water and afterward placed in an ice chest if the milk
is to be pasteurized or sterilized this should precede the cooling
directions for feeding infants
how should the bottle be prepared at feeding time
it should be taken from the ice chest and warmed by standing in warm
water which is deep enough to cover the milk in the bottle it should
then be thoroughly shaken and the nipple adjusted the nurse should
see that the hole in the nipple is not too large nor too small
how may the temperature of the milk be tested
never by putting the nipple in the nurses mouth before adjusting the
nipple a teaspoonful may be poured from the bottle and tasted or a
few drops may be poured through the nipple upon the inner surface of
the wrist where it should feel quite warm but never hot or a
thermometer may be placed in the water in which the bottle stands a
dairy thermometer should be used and the temperature of the water
should be between 98 and 105 f
what is a simple contrivance for keeping the milk warm during
feeding
a small flannel bag with a draw string may be slipped over the bottle
in what position should an infant take its bottle
for the first two or three months it is better except at night when
it may be undesirable to take the infant from its crib that it be
held on the nurses arm during the feeding later it may lie on its
side in the crib provided the bottle is held by the nurse until it has
been emptied otherwise a young infant readily falls into the bad
habit of alternately sucking and sleeping and often will be an hour
or more over its bottle
how much time should be allowed for one feeding
never more than twenty minutes the bottle should then be taken away
and not given until the next feeding time under no circumstances
should an infant form the habit of sleeping with the nipple in its
mouth a sleepy infant should be kept awake by gentle shaking until
the food is taken or the bottle should be removed altogether
should an infant be played with soon after feeding
on no account such a thing frequently causes vomiting and sometimes
indigestion after every feeding the infant should be allowed to lie
quietly in its crib and disturbed as little as possible
intervals of feeding
how often should a baby be fed during the first month
every two hours during the day and twice during the night or ten
feedings during the twentyfour hours
at what age may the interval be made two and a half hours
usually at five or six weeks
when may it be increased to three hours
usually at two months
why should not a child be fed more frequently
it takes the stomach nearly two hours to digest a meal at two months
and about two and a half hours at five or six months and if the meals
are too near together the second one is given before the first has
been digested and vomiting and indigestion result the meals should be
far enough apart to give the stomach a little time for rest just
before each feeding

this schedule gives the averages for healthy children the smaller
quantities are those required by small children whose digestion is not
very vigorous the larger quantities are those required by large
children with strong digestion in very few cases will it be advisable
to go above these figures
the interval is reckoned from the beginning of one feeding to the
beginning of the next one
when should the interval between the feedings be lengthened
when there is gastric indigestion as shown by habitual vomiting or the
regurgitation of food long after the bottle is finished also when the
appetite is very poor so that the infant regularly leaves some of its
food
when should the interval between the feedings be shortened
this is done much too frequently it is rarely advisable to feed any
infant except one seriously ill oftener than the time put down in
the schedule
regularity in feeding
how can a baby be taught to be regular in its habits of eating and
sleeping
by always feeding at regular intervals and putting to sleep at exactly
the same time every day and evening
when should regular training be begun
during the first week of life
should a baby be wakened to be nursed or fed if sleeping quietly
yes for a few days this will not be required long for with regular
feeding an infant soon wakes regularly for its meal almost upon the
minute
should regularity in feeding be kept up at night as well as during
the day
only up to nine or ten oclock after that time a baby should be
allowed to sleep as long as it will
at what age may a well baby go without food from 10 pm to 6 or 7
am
usually at four months and always at five or six months night
feeding is one of the most frequent causes of wakefulness and
disturbed sleep
sterilized milk
what is meant by sterilizing milk
heating milk for the purpose of destroying germs
does all cows milk contain germs
yes even when handled most carefully milk contains many germs but
when carelessly handled and in summer the number is enormous while
most of these are harmless or cause only the souring of milk others
are occasionally present which may produce serious diseases such as
typhoid fever diphtheria scarlet fever cholera tuberculosis and
many forms of diarrhoea
under what circumstances is it necessary to sterilize milk
1 in warm weather when it cannot be obtained fresh hence always in
cities and towns during the summer
2 when one cannot be certain that the cows are healthy or that the
milk has been carefully handled
3 when the milk is to be kept for any considerable time ie over
twentyfour hours especially if no ice can be had
4 during epidemics of typhoid fever scarlet fever diphtheria or
any form of diarrhoeal disease
what are the two methods of heating milk
the first is known as sterilizing in which the milk is heated to
212 f for one hour or one hour and a half the second is known as
pasteurizing in which the milk is heated to 155 or 170 f for
thirty minutes a temperature of 155 f continued for thirty minutes
is sufficient to kill the germs of the diseases above referred to
will milk which has been thus treated keep indefinitely
no for although all the living germs may be killed there are many
undeveloped germs or spores which are not destroyed and which soon
grow into living germs milk heated to 212 f for an hour will keep
upon ice for two or three weeks that heated to 155 f for two or
three days
is milk which has been sterilized always a safe food
no for the reason that the milk may be so old so dirty and so
contaminated before sterilizing that it may be still unfit for food
though it contains no living germs
is cows milk rendered more digestible by being heated in this way
sterilizing milk does not improve its digestibility but rather the
contrary sterilized milk should be modified for infant feeding in the
same way as milk which has not been heated
is milk in any way injured by heating to 212 f for an hour
there is abundant evidence that milk is rendered less digestible by
such heating also that it is more constipating and that for some
children its nutritive properties are interfered with so that it may
cause scurvy this however is not seen unless it is continued as the
sole food for a long period these objections are of so much
importance that this plan of heating milk is not to be recommended for
general use
when is it advantageous to heat milk to 212 f
for use upon long journeys such as crossing the ocean milk should
then be heated for one hour upon two successive days without removing
the cotton stoppers from the bottles
is milk in any way injured by heating to 155 f for thirty minutes
this point is not yet definitely settled such heating does not affect
the taste of milk and does not render it more constipating the
unfavourable effects if there are any are so slight that they need
not deter one from the use of pasteurized milk even for long periods
the preference however should always be given to milk which is so
clean and so fresh as not to require any heating
how should milk be pasteurized
a convenient form of apparatus is that known as freemans
pasteurizer5 another is the walkergordon pasteurizer6
    5 this can be obtained at 411 west fiftyninth street new
    york with bottles and full directions a tin one at a cost of
    350 and a copper one which is much more durable for 700
    6 obtained at the same prices from any of the walkergordon
    milk laboratories
how should milk be cooled after pasteurizing
always by placing the bottles in cold water so as to cool them
rapidly never by letting them stand at the temperature of the room
or by placing them when warm in an ice box
why is this precaution necessary
cooling in the air or in an ice box requires from two to four hours
and during that time a great many of the undeveloped germs may mature
and greatly injure the keeping properties of the milk in the cold
water milk can be cooled in from ten to twenty minutes if the water
is frequently changed or if ice is added to the water
modified milk of the milk laboratories
what is modified milk of the milk laboratories
it is milk containing definite proportions of the fat sugar
proteids etc put up usually according to the prescription of a
physician who indicates how much of the different elements he
desires the most reliable are the laboratories of the walkergordon
company which has branches in many of the large cities of the united
states
this is an excellent method of having milk prepared since it can be
done with greater care and cleanliness than are possible in most
homes it is besides a great convenience if circumstances make it
impossible to prepare the milk properly at home
the laboratory should be used for infant feeding only by one who is
somewhat familiar with this method of ordering milk
peptonized milk
what is peptonized milk
milk in which the proteids curd have been partially digested
how is this accomplished
by the action of a peptonizing powder which is composed of a digestive
agent known as the extractum pancreatis and bicarbonate of soda which
is added to the plain or diluted milk this is sold in tubes or in
tablets and it is the active ingredient of the peptogenic milk
powder
describe the process
the plain or modified milk is placed in a clean glass jar or bottle
and the peptonizing powder which is first rubbed up with a
tablespoonful of the milk is added and the bottle shaken the bottle
is then placed in a large pitcher or basin containing water kept at
the temperature of about 110 f or as warm as the hand can bear
comfortably and left for ten to twenty minutes if the milk is to be
partially peptonized for two hours if it is to be completely
peptonized
what taste has partially peptonized milk
none if peptonizing is continued for only ten minutes but at the end
of twenty minutes it begins to be bitter when the process of
digestion has gone further
how is the bitter taste avoided in partially peptonized milk
at the end of ten or fifteen minutes the milk may be placed in a
saucepan and quickly raised to boiling point this kills the ferment
so that the milk will not become bitter when warmed a second time or
the milk may be rapidly cooled by placing the bottles first in cool
and then in ice water in this way the ferment is not destroyed and
the milk may become bitter when warmed for feeding
should the whole days supply be peptonized at once or each bottle
separately just before the feeding
either plan may be followed if the former it is better to raise the
milk to boiling point after peptonizing if the latter it should not
be peptonized more than ten minutes for it will continue to peptonize
while it is being taken by the child
is not the bitter taste of completely peptonized milk a great
obstacle to its use
not in the case of young infants one under four or five months old
will usually take it without any objection after two or three
feedings but it cannot often be used for those who are much older
how much of the peptonizing powder should be used
there are required for one pint of plain milk five grains of the
extractum pancreatis and fifteen grains of bicarbonate of soda this
quantity is usually put up in a single tube or tablet in the formulas
previously given less than this will be required for the weaker
formulas one half or one third of the powder mentioned will be
sufficient for one pint of food for a single feeding of four ounces
one may use one eighth of a tube with a weak formula or one sixth of
a tube with a stronger formula
what are the advantages of peptonized milk
partially peptonized milk is useful for young infants who have great
difficulty in digesting the curd of milk sometimes even when diluted
as already described completely peptonized milk during acute attacks
of indigestion
for how long a period may the use of peptonized milk be continued
completely peptonized milk may be used for a few days or at most a
few weeks partially peptonized milk may be used for two or three
months but not indefinitely it should be left off gradually by
shortening the time of peptonizing and lessening the amount of the
powder used
feeding during the second year
how many meals are required during the second year
it is usually better to continue five meals throughout the second
year some children will sleep from 6 pm to 6 am without waking
but unless there is a feeding at 10 pm children are apt to wake very
early in the morning
should each feeding be prepared at the time it is given or all
feedings at one time as during the first year
during the second and third years it is better to prepare the milk for
the entire day at one time if it is to be modified by adding cream
water etc it is done as during the first year
later when only plain milk is used the quantities needed for the
different feedings should be put into one or into two bottles which
then may be pasteurized or not as may be necessary in this way the
different feedings are kept separate and the days supply of milk is
not disturbed every time the child is fed as otherwise is
unavoidable the food should be prepared as soon as possible after the
daily milk supply is delivered in the morning
give a proper diet for an average healthy child of twelve months
630 am  milk six to seven ounces diluted with barley or oat
               gruel two to three ounces after the thirteenth
               month taken from a cup
   9 am  orange juice one to two ounces
  10 am  milk two parts oatmeal or barley gruel one part
               from ten to twelve ounces in all may be allowed
               it should be given from a cup
   2 pm  beef juice one to two ounces
             or the white of one egg slightly cooked later the
               entire egg
             or mutton or chicken broth four to six ounces
           milk and gruel in proportions above given four to
               six ounces
   6 pm  same as at 10 am
  10 pm  same as at 630 am except that the milk may be
               given from the bottle
how long may this schedule be followed
usually until the fourteenth or fifteenth month after this time the
cereals may be given much thicker and fed from a spoon
may any other fruit juices be given at this period
orange juice is the best next to this the juice of fresh ripe
peaches red raspberries or strawberries all these should be strained
very carefully through muslin to make sure that the child gets none of
the pulp or seeds either of which may cause serious disturbance of
the orange or peach juice from one to four tablespoonfuls may be
allowed at one time of the others about half the quantity the fruit
juice is best given one hour before the second feeding
when should a child be weaned from its bottle
most children can and should be taught to take their food from the cup
or spoon by the time they are thirteen months old but it is
convenient to give the 10 pm feeding from the bottle during the
greater part of the second year see page 52
give a proper diet for an average child from the fourteenth to the
eighteenth month
the bottle should not be given except at night cereals may now form
an important part of the diet they should be very thoroughly cooked
usually for three hours and strained
the daily schedule should be about as follows
630 am  milk warmed eight to ten ounces given from a cup
   9 am  fruit juice one to three ounces
  10 am  cereal one later two or three tablespoonfuls of oatmeal
               hominy or wheaten grits cooked for at
               least three hours upon this from one to two
               ounces of thin cream or milk and cream with
               plenty of salt but without sugar
           crisp dry toast one piece
             or unsweetened zwieback
             or one huntley and palmer breakfast biscuit
           milk warmed six to eight ounces from a cup
   2 pm  beef juice one to two ounces and one egg soft
               boiled poached or coddled and boiled rice one
               tablespoonful
             or broth mutton or chicken four ounces one or
               two huntley and palmer breakfast biscuits or
               zwieback and if most of the teeth are present
               rare scraped meat at first one teaspoonful gradually
               increasing to one tablespoonful
   6 pm  cereal two tablespoonfuls of farina cream of wheat
             or arrowroot cooked for at least one half hour
               with milk plenty of salt but without sugar
           milk warmed eight to ten ounces given from a cup
  10 pm  milk warmed eight to ten ounces which may be
               given from a bottle
give a proper diet for an average child from the eighteenth month to
the end of the second year
the same order of meals as for the months just preceding should be
followed for most children milk at 10 pm is desirable there are
many however who sleep regularly from 6 pm until 6 am without
food for such the night feeding should of course not be insisted
upon
the daily schedule should be about as follows
630 am  milk warmed ten to twelve ounces given from cup
   9 am  fruit juice two to three ounces
  10 am  cereals similar to those given from the fourteenth
               to the eighteenth month they need not be
               strained although they should be cooked and
               served in the same way
           crisp dry bread zwieback or huntley and palmer
               biscuits without butter
           milk warmed one cup
   2 pm  beef juice and one egg
             or broth and meat care being taken that the
               meat is always rare and scraped or very finely
               divided beefsteak mutton chop or roast beef
               may be given
           very stale bread or two pieces of zwieback
           prune pulp or baked apple one to two tablespoonfuls
           water no milk
   6 pm  cereal farina cream of wheat or arrowroot cooked
               for at least one half hour with milk plenty of
               salt but without sugar
             or milk toast or stale bread and milk
  10 pm  if required ten to twelve ounces of plain milk
what fruits may be given at this period
if the child has a feeble digestion only the fruit juices previously
allowed strong children may have in addition prune pulp baked apple
and applesauce the prune pulp is prepared by stewing the dried prunes
without sugar until they are very soft and removing all the skin by
putting the fruit through a strainer of this from one to two
tablespoonfuls may be given at one time the baked apple should be
given without cream and the applesauce should have very little sugar
how and when should water be given
throughout the second year water should be given freely between the
feedings especially in warm weather from one to three ounces may be
given at one time either from a spoon a glass or a bottle the
water should be boiled daily and then cooled it should not be allowed
to stand in the room but fresh water should be put into the bottle
each time
feeding during the third year
what changes may be made in the diet during the third year
the night feeding at 10 pm should be omitted a greater quantity of
solid food may be allowed particularly at the midday meal it is not
advisable to begin potato and other vegetables until this age is
reached three regular meals should be given and milk once besides
either between the breakfast and dinner or dinner and supper
whichever is the longer interval water should be allowed freely
between meals
what would be a proper schedule for an average child during the third
year
730 am  cereal cooked preferably over night for three
               hours although a somewhat larger variety may
               be given than during the second year given as
               before with milk or thin cream salt but very
               little sugar

               spinach all to be cooked until very soft and
               mashed or preferably put through a sieve at
               first one or two teaspoonfuls

               for at least one half hour with plenty of salt
               but without sugar
             or milk toast
             or bread and milk
             or stale or dry bread and butter and a glass of milk
part iii
the diet of older children fourth to tenth year
throughout this period the largest meal should always be in the middle
of the day and a light supper given very much like that described
for the third year during the first half of this period milk may be
allowed once either between breakfast and dinner or dinner and supper
no other eating between meals should be permitted but water should be
allowed freely
milk and cream
what part of the diet should milk form during childhood
it should form a very important part up to the tenth year nothing can
take its place there are comparatively few children who cannot take
and digest milk if it is properly fed
why is milk so advantageous
because no food that we possess has so high a nutritive value as milk
for the amount of work required of the organs of digestion it is
therefore peculiarly adapted to the diet of the child
what are the essential points in the use of milk
it should be clean and fresh but not too rich it is a mistake to
select for any children the rich milk of a jersey herd and use it as
though it were an ordinary milk for children who have difficulty in
digesting milk it should be somewhat diluted ie one part of water
to four parts of milk or salt or bicarbonate of soda should be added
it is also important not to give milk at meals when fruits especially
sour fruits are allowed
how much milk may advantageously be given
the average child with good digestion should take from one and one
half pints to one quart of milk daily this including not only what
the child drinks but what is served upon cereals and in other ways it
is seldom wise to allow a child to take as much as two quarts daily
as a more mixed diet for most children is better
to what extent may cream be used
older children do not require so large a proportion of fat in their
food as do infants and the use of cream especially very rich cream
often results in disturbances of digestion the use of too much or too
rich cream is a common cause of the coated tongue foul breath and
pale gray stools often called biliousness
is not cream useful in overcoming the constipation of children
with infants it is valuable to a certain point but with older
children only to a limited degree and if such symptoms as those above
described are present cream should not be given
eggs
to what extent may eggs be used in the diet of this period
they form a most valuable food it is essential that they should be
fresh and only slightly cooked soft boiled poached or coddled fried
eggs should never be given and all omelets are objectionable
which is more digestible the white or yolk of the egg
for the great majority of children the white of the egg this forms
one of the most digestible proteids we possess and can be used even
in the latter part of the first year with advantage
is it not true that eggs often cause biliousness
very seldom if fed as above advised this is an old prejudice but has
little basis in fact
how often may eggs be given
most children from four to ten years old will take one egg for
breakfast and another for supper for an indefinite period with relish
and benefit there are however some few who have a peculiar
idiosyncrasy as regards eggs and cannot take them at all
meat and fish
what meats may be given to young children
the best are beefsteak muttonchop roast beef roast lamb broiled
chicken and certain delicate fish such as shad or bass
what are the important points to be considered in giving meat to
children
most meats should be rare and either scraped or very finely divided
as no child can be trusted to chew meat properly meats are best
broiled or roasted but should not be fried
how often should meat be given
at this period only once a day at the midday meal
is not the excessive nervousness of many modern children due to the
giving of meat or at least aggravated by its use
there is little ground for such a belief unless an excessive amount
of meat is given certainly cutting off meat from the diet of nervous
children seldom produces any striking benefit
what meats should be forbidden to young children
ham bacon sausage pork liver kidney game and all dried and
salted meats also cod mackerel and halibut all of these are best
withheld until the child has passed the tenth year
are not gravies beneficial and nutritious
the beef juice or socalled platter gravy from a roast is
exceedingly nutritious and desirable but many of the thickened
gravies are much less digestible and are too often given in excess
only a small quantity should be allowed they should not form an
important part of the meal
vegetables
what vegetables may be used at this period
white potatoes may be given first these should preferably be baked or
boiled and mashed but never fried they should be served with beef
juice or with cream rather than with butter
of the green vegetables the best are peas spinach asparagus tips
string beans stewed celery young beets or carrots and squash
baked sweet potato turnips boiled onions and cauliflower all well
cooked may be given after the sixth or seventh year in moderate
amount
the principal trouble in the digestion of vegetables is due to
imperfect cooking it is in fact almost impossible to cook them too
much they should also be very finely mashed they form a valuable
addition to the diet after three years although the amount at first
given should be small one or two teaspoonfuls they greatly aid in
securing regularity of the bowels because small particles are seen in
the stools it is not to be inferred that they are causing disturbance
and should therefore be stopped but only that they should be more
thoroughly cooked and more finely divided before being given
is it safe to use canned vegetables for children
many of the best brands of canned vegetables are quite safe and some
such as peas and asparagus can be used with advantage they are
frequently better than stale green vegetables often sold in the
markets
what vegetables should not be given to young children
none of those which are eaten raw such as celery radishes onions
cucumbers tomatoes or lettuce certain others even when well cooked
should not be allowed as corn lima beans cabbage egg plant none
of these should be given until a child has passed the age of ten
years
are vegetable salads to be given
as a rule salads of all kinds should be omitted until a child has
passed the tenth year salads are difficult to digest and a cause of
much disturbance in children of all ages
cereals
what are the most important points in selecting and preparing
cereals
the important things are that they are properly cooked and not used in
excess the readytoserve cereals should never be chosen for
children nor should a child because he is fond of cereals be
allowed to make his entire meal of them taking two or three
saucerfuls at a feeding
many of the partially cooked preparations of oatmeal and wheat are
excellent but should be cooked for a much longer time than is stated
upon the package usually three or four times as long digestibility
is chiefly a matter of proper cooking most of the grainsoatmeal
hominy rice wheaten gritsrequire at least three hours cooking in
a double boiler in order to be easily digested the prepared
flourscorn starch arrowroot barleyshould be cooked at least
twenty minutes i know of no preparation in the modern market which
requires no cooking which is to be recommended for children
how are cereals to be given
usually with milk or a mixture of milk and cream always with an
abundance of salt and with very little or no sugar one half
teaspoonful on a saucerful of cereal should be the limit
cereals should not be served with syrups or butter and sugar
broths and soups
what broths and soups are to be recommended
meat broths are generally to be preferred to vegetable brothsmutton
or chicken being usually most liked by children nearly all plain
broths may be given those thickened with rice barley or corn starch
form a useful variety especially with the addition of milk
vegetable purees of peas spinach celery or asparagus may be used for
children over seven years old tomato soup should not be given to
young children
bread crackers and cakes
what forms of breadstuffs are best suited to young children
fresh bread should not be given but stale bread cut thin and freshly
dried in the oven until it is crisp is very useful also zwieback the
unsweetened being preferred oatmeal graham or gluten crackers and
the huntley and palmer breakfast biscuits stale rolls or corn bread
which has been split and toasted or dried till crisp form a
sufficient variety for most children
what breadstuffs should be forbidden
all hot breads all fresh rolls all buckwheat and other griddle
cakes all fresh sweet cakes especially those covered with icing and
those containing dried fruits a stale ladyfinger or piece of sponge
cake is about as far in the matter of cakes as it is wise to go with
children up to seven or eight years old
desserts
what desserts may be given to young children
mistakes are more often made here than in any other part of the
childs diet up to six or seven years only junket plain rice
pudding without raisins plain custard and not more than once a week
a small amount of ice cream
what should be especially forbidden
all pies tarts and pastry of every description jam syrups and
preserved fruits nuts candy and dried fruits
does a little do any harm
yes in that it develops a taste for this sort of food after which
plainer food is taken with less relish besides the little is very
apt soon to become a good deal
does not the childs instinctive craving for sweets indicate his need
of them
that a child likes or craves sweets is the usual excuse of an
indulgent parent every child likes his own way but that is no reason
why he should not be trained to obedience and selfcontrol a childs
fondness for sweets can hardly be considered a normal instinct as a
matter of fact supported by everyday experience no causes are
productive of more disorders of digestion than the free indulgence in
desserts and sweets by young children it is a constantly increasing
tendency not easily controlled as a child grows older and in early
childhood the only safe rule is to give none at all
fruits
are fruits an essential or important part of the diet
they are a very important part and should be begun in infancy they
are particularly useful for the effect they have upon the bowels it
is important that they should be selected with care and given with
much discretion especially in cities in the country where fruit is
absolutely fresh a somewhat greater latitude may be allowed than is
given below
what fruits may safely be given to children up to five years old
as a general rule only cooked fruits and the juices of fresh fruits
what fruit juices may be used
that from sweet oranges is the best but the fresh juice of grape
fruit peaches strawberries and raspberries may also be used
what stewed fruits may be given
stewed or baked apples prunes pears peaches and apricots
what raw fruits are to be particularly avoided with young children
the pulp of oranges or grape fruit also cherries berries bananas
and pineapple
what precautions should be emphasized regarding the use of fruits
that they should be used with greater care in hot weather and with
children who are prone to attacks of intestinal indigestion
what symptoms indicate that fruits should be avoided
a tendency to looseness of the bowels with the discharge of mucus or
frequent attacks of abdominal pain or stomach ache
is there any special choice of meals at which fruit should be given
the fruit juice given early in the morning upon an empty stomach
works more actively upon the bowels than if it is given later in the
day
it is not as a rule wise to give cream or milk with sour fruits
usually the fruit is best given at the midday meal as a dessert at
a time when no milk is taken it is in all cases important that the
quantity of fruit should be moderate
what besides water and milk should a child be allowed to drink and
what should be forbidden
tea coffee wine beer and cider in all quantities and in all forms
should be forbidden to young children below puberty cocoa which is
made very weak ie almost all milk is often useful as a hot drink
lemonade sodawater etc should if possible be deferred until the
tenth year a free indulgence in things of this kind should never be
permitted with children of seven or eight years
indigestion in older children
what are the different ways in which indigestion shows itself in
children
first in acute disturbances which last for a few days only and
secondly in chronic disturbances which may continue for weeks or
months
which of the two forms of indigestion is more likely to impair
seriously the health of the child
chronic indigestion for since the cause is not recognized it often
goes on for months and even years unchecked
what are the symptoms of acute indigestion
these are familiar and easily recognized they are vomiting pain
undigested movements from the bowels often fever and considerable
prostration
such attacks are usually traceable to their proper cause the removal
of which is followed by prompt recovery
what are the common causes of acute indigestion
this is frequently due to overeating to indulgence in some special
article of improper food or to eating heartily when overtired acute
indigestion often marks the beginning of some acute general illness
how should acute indigestion be managed
one should bear in mind that for the time being the digestive organs
have stopped work altogether the important thing therefore is to
clear out from the intestines all undigested food by some active
cathartic such as castor oil the stomach has usually emptied itself
by vomiting all food should be stopped for from twelve to thirtysix
hours according to the severity of the attack only water being
given
at the end of this time is it safe to begin with the former diet
no for such a procedure is almost certain to cause another attack of
indigestion at first only broth thin gruel very greatly diluted
milk or whey should be given the diet may be very slowly but
gradually increased as the childs appetite and digestion improve but
in most cases a week or ten days should elapse before the full diet is
resumed
what are the symptoms of chronic indigestion
these although familiar are not so easily distinguished and are very
often attributed to the wrong cause there are usually general
symptoms such as indisposition disturbed sleep grinding of the
teeth fretfulness languor loss of weight and anmia there are
besides local symptoms flatulence abdominal pain abdominal
distention constipation or looseness of the bowels with mucus in the
stools foul breath coated tongue loss of appetite or an abnormal
capricious appetite such symptoms are often wrongly ascribed to
intestinal worms
what are the common causes of chronic indigestion
this is generally the result of a bad system of feeding either the
prolonged use of improper food or of improper methods of feeding
examples of bad methods of feeding are coaxing or forcing to eat
rapid eating with insufficient mastication eating between meals
allowing a child to have his own way in selecting his food as when he
lives largely upon a single article of diet things to be considered
under the head of improper food are indulgence in sweets desserts
etc the use of imperfectly cooked foods especially cereals and
vegetables and of raw or stale fruits
is it not true that a diet or a special article of food which does
not make a child ill is proof that such a diet or such a food is
proper for a child
by no means with many people the only guide in feeding children is
that the article in question did not make the children sick therefore
it is allowable this is a very bad principle a better one is to
adopt such a diet as will nourish the childs body with the least
possible tax upon his digestive organs in other words to exclude
articles which experience has shown to be injurious to most children
how should chronic indigestion be managed
this is a much more difficult matter than the treatment of acute
indigestion for as it is usually the result of the prolonged use of
improper food or of an improper method of feeding a cure can be
accomplished only by a discovery and removal of the cause
is chronic indigestion curable
in the vast majority of cases it is so but only by faithfully
observing for a long period the rules for simple feeding laid down
elsewhere one of the greatest difficulties in the way of recovery is
that parents and nurses are unwilling to follow a restricted diet long
enough to secure a complete cure or to change radically their methods
of feeding but expect the child to recover by simply taking medicine
for how long a period is it necessary to continue very careful
feeding
in any case it must be done for several months with most children for
two or three years with some throughout childhood for with them the
slightest deviation from established rules is sure to provoke a
relapse
is not medicine useful
it is undoubtedly of assistance for the relief of some symptoms but
the essential thing is proper feeding without which nothing permanent
can be accomplished
general rules to be observed in feeding
bad habits of eating are readily acquired but difficult to break
young children should not be allowed to play with their food nor
should the habit be formed of amusing or diverting them while eating
because by these means more food is taken
older children should not be permitted to make an entire meal of one
thing no matter how proper this may be
children who are allowed to have their own way in matters of eating
are very likely to be badly trained in other respects while those who
have been properly trained in matters of eating can usually be easily
trained to do anything else that is important
learning to eat proper things in a proper way forms therefore a large
part of a childs early education if careful training in these
matters is begun at the outset and continued the results will well
repay the time and effort required
whether the child feeds himself or is fed by the nurse the following
rules should be observed
1 food at regular hours only nothing between meals
2 plenty of time should be taken on no account should the child bolt
his food
3 the child must be taught to chew his food yet no matter how much
pains are taken in this respect mastication is very imperfectly done
by all children hence up to the seventh year at least all meats
should be very finely cut all vegetables mashed to a pulp and all
grains cooked very soft
4 children should not be continually urged to eat if they are
disinclined to do so at their regular hours of feeding or if the
appetite is habitually poor and under no circumstances should a child
be forced to eat
5 indigestible food should never be given to tempt the appetite when
the ordinary simple food is refused food should not be allowed
between meals because it is refused at mealtime
6 one serious objection to allowing young children highly seasoned
food entrees jellies pastry sweets etc even in such small
amounts as not to upset the digestion is that children thus indulged
soon lose appetite for the simple food which previously was taken with
relish
7 if there is any important article of a simple diet such as milk
meat cereals or vegetables which a child habitually refuses this
should always be given first at the meal and other food withheld until
it is disposed of children so readily form habits of eating only
certain things and refusing others that such an inclination should be
checked early
8 if an infant refuses its food altogether or takes less than usual
the food should be examined to see if this is right then the mouth
should be inspected to see if it is sore if neither of these things
is the cause the food should be taken away and not offered again
until the next feeding time comes
9 in any acute illness the amount of food should be much reduced and
the food made more dilute than usual if there is fever no solid food
should be given if the child is already upon a milk diet this should
be diluted and in some cases partially peptonized
10 in very hot weather the same rules hold to give less food
particularly less solid food and more water
food formulas
beef juiceone pound of rare round steak cut thick slightly
broiled and the juice pressed out by a lemonsqueezer or better a
meatpress from two to four ounces of juice can generally be
obtained this seasoned with salt may be given cold or warmed by
placing the cup which holds it in warm water it should not be heated
sufficiently to coagulate the albumin which is in solution and which
then appears as flakes of meat floating in the fluid
beef juice by the cold processone pound of finely chopped round
steak six ounces of cold water a pinch of salt place in a covered
jar and stand on ice or in a cold place five or six hours or
overnight it is well to shake occasionally this is now strained and
all the juice squeezed out by placing the meat in coarse muslin and
twisting it very hard it is then seasoned and fed like the above
beef juice so made is not quite as palatable as that prepared from
broiled steak but it is even more nutritious and is more economical
as fully twice as much juice can be obtained from a given quantity of
meat beef juice prepared in either of these ways is greatly to be
preferred to the beef extracts sold
mutton brothone pound of finely chopped lean mutton including
some of the bone one pint cold water pinch of salt cook for three
hours over a slow fire down to half a pint adding water if necessary
strain through muslin and when cold carefully remove the fat adding
more salt if required it may be fed warm or cold in the form of a
jelly
a very nutritious and delicious broth is made by thickening this with
cornstarch or arrowroot cooking for ten minutes and then adding three
ounces of milk or one ounce and a half of thin cream to a half pint
of broth
chicken veal and beef brothsthese are made and used in
precisely the same manner as mutton broth
meat pulpa rare piece of round or sirloin steak the outer part
having been cut away is scraped or shredded with a knife one
teaspoonful to one tablespoonful may be given well salted to a child
of eighteen months scraping is much better than cutting the meat
fine
for this on a large scale as in institutions a hamburgsteak cutter
may be employed
junket or curds and wheyone pint of fresh cows milk warmed
pinch of salt a teaspoonful of granulated sugar add two teaspoonfuls
of fairchilds essence of pepsin or liquid rennet or one junket
tablet dissolved in water stir for a moment and then allow it to
stand at the temperature of the room for twenty minutes or until
firmly coagulated place in the ice box until thoroughly cold for
older children this may be seasoned with grated nutmeg
wheythe coagulated milk prepared as above is broken up with a
fork and the whey strained off through muslin it is best given cold
if some stimulant is desired sherry wine in the proportion of one
part to twelve or brandy one part to twentyfour may be added whey
is useful in many cases of acute indigestion
barley jelly from the grainsthree tablespoonfuls of pearl barley
soak overnight then place this in one quart of fresh water add pinch
of salt and cook in double boiler steadily for four hours down to one
pint adding water from time to time strain through muslin when cold
this makes a rather thick jelly if a thinner gruel barley water is
desired one half the quantity of barley should be used
oat wheat or rice jellythese are prepared from oatmeal wheaten
grits and rice grains in the same manner as the barley jelly
barley jelly from the floureither robinsons patent barley or
prepared barley flour of the health food company may be used one
rounded tablespoonful of the flour thoroughly blended with a little
cold water is added stirring to one pint of boiling water
containing a pinch of salt cook for twenty minutes in a double
boiler and strain this makes a jelly of about the consistency of
that made from the grains as above it is essentially the same in
composition and much less trouble to prepare a thinner gruel barley
water is made by using half the quantity of flour
when this is to be mixed with milk it is well to add the milk to the
barley gruel before removing from the fire and stir two or three
minutes or until the milk has nearly reached the boiling point when
it should be removed and bottled
oat or wheat jelly from the flourthese are made from the prepared
oat flour of the health food company or hubbells prepared wheat
flour they are used like the barley
imperial granumthis is prepared and used in precisely the same
way as the barley flour above mentioned the gruel being mixed with
milk before it is removed from the fire
albumin waterthe white of one fresh egg half a pint of cold
water pinch of salt teaspoonful of brandy this should be shaken
thoroughly and fed cold either with a spoon or from a bottle it is
useful in cases of vomiting and can sometimes be retained by a very
irritable stomach
limewaterone heaping teaspoonful of slaked lime one quart
boiled or distilled water place in a corked bottle and shake
thoroughly two or three times during the first hour the lime should
then be allowed to settle and after twentyfour hours the upper clear
fluid carefully poured or siphoned off for use
dried breadeither stale or fresh bread may be used it is cut in
thin slices and placed in the oven with the door open and quickly
dried until it is crisp but not browned it is in many respects
preferable to crackers for little children
coddled egga fresh egg shell on is placed in boiling water
which is immediately after removed from the fire the egg then cooks
slowly in the water which gradually cools for seven or eight
minutes when the white should be about the consistency of jelly for
a delicate digestion the white only should be given with salt it can
be easily separated from the yolk
part iv
miscellaneous
the bowels
how many movements daily should an infant have during the first few
weeks of life
usually two or three a day for the first week and then one or two
each day
how many after a child is a month old
a healthy child should have at least one movement each day many have
two and some more than two but it is the character of the stools
rather than their number which is to be taken as the evidence of
perfect digestion
what is the appearance of a healthy movement of a child who is taking
nothing but milk
it is soft yellow and smooth containing no lumps
when are the stools dark brown or black
while taking bismuth iron and sometimes when taking much meat or
beef juice also while taking many of the prepared foods they may be
dark brown or black from blood this last is a condition which may
indicate serious illness
how may a child be trained to be regular in the action of its
bowels
by endeavouring to have them move at exactly the same time every day
at what age may an infant be trained in this way
usually by the second month if training is begun early
what is the best method of training
a small chamber about the size of a pint bowl is placed between the
nurses knees and upon this the infant is held its back being
against the nurses chest and its body firmly supported this should
be done twice a day after the morning and afternoon feedings and
always at the same hour at first there may be necessary some local
irritation like that produced by tickling the anus or introducing
just inside the rectum a small cone of oiled paper or a piece of soap
as a suggestion of the purpose for which the baby is placed upon the
chamber but in a surprisingly short time the position is all that is
required with most infants after a few weeks the bowels will move as
soon as the infant is placed on the chamber
what advantage has such training
it forms the habit of having the bowels move regularly at the same
hour which is a matter of great importance in infancy and makes
regularity in childhood much easier it also saves the nurse much
trouble and labour
sleep
should a child sleep in the same bed with its mother or nurse
under no circumstances if this can possibly be avoided very young
infants have often been smothered by their mothers by overlying
during sleep if the infant sleeps with the mother there is always
the temptation to frequent nursing at night which is injurious to
both mother and child older children also should if possible have
separate beds many contagious diseases and bad habits are contracted
by children sleeping together
how should an infants bed be prepared
the mattress should be firm but soft the pillow very thin and the
covering not excessive a baby should not be allowed to sleep always
in the same position but should be changed from side to side hair
pillows are useful in summer and for children who perspire very much
how much sleep is natural for a newly born baby
a baby with a good digestion and proper food will usually sleep at
this period about nine tenths of the time
how much should a baby sleep at six months
about two thirds of the time
up to what age should an older child take a nap during the day
always until four years old and if possible longer
at what age may an infant go all night without feeding
at five months a child should not be fed or nursed between 10 pm and
6 am at two years a child can easily go from 6 pm to 6 am
without feeding
how should a baby be put to sleep
the room should be darkened and quiet the childs hunger satisfied
and the child made generally comfortable and laid in its crib while
awake
is rocking necessary
by no means it is a habit easily acquired but hard to break and a
very useless and sometimes injurious one the same may be said of
sucking a rubber nipple or pacifier and all other devices for
putting children to sleep
what are the principal causes of disturbed sleep
as quiet peaceful sleep is a sign of perfect health disorders of
sleep may be produced by almost anything which is wrong with the
child
1 habitual disturbance of sleep in infants is most frequently
associated with the food or feeding it may be from the discomfort of
chronic indigestion due to improper food in bottlefed infants it is
often the result of overfeeding in those who are nursed it is often
due to hunger a common cause is frequent night feeding an infant who
is fed three or four times during the night is almost invariably a bad
sleeper
2 disturbed sleep or sleeplessness may be due to causes purely
nervous such are bad habits acquired by faulty training as when the
nursery is lighted and the child taken from its crib whenever it wakes
or cries or when some of the contrivances for inducing sleep have
been used any excitement or romping play just before bedtime and
fears aroused by pictures or stories are frequent causes children
who inherit from their parents a nervous constitution are especially
likely to suffer thus
3 there may be physical discomfort from cold feet insufficient or
too much clothing or want of fresh air in the sleeping room
4 interference with breathing due to obstruction from large tonsils
or adenoids these cause great restlessness and lead a child to assume
many different postures during sleep often lying upon the face or
upon the hands and knees
5 chronic pains or frequently recurring night pains may be causes of
disordered sleep when a child wakes with a sudden sharp cry in
infants this is most often due to scurvy sometimes to syphilis in
older children it may be the earliest symptom of disease of the hip or
spine
6 sleeplessness and disturbed sleep are frequent whenever the general
condition falls much below a healthy standard eg in infants who
are not thriving and in children suffering from marked anmia
how are children who sleep too little or whose sleep is constantly
disturbed to be treated
never by the use of soothing sirups or other medicines successful
treatment consists in the discovery and removal of the cause
do children ever sleep too much
it is doubtful if healthy children ever do excessive sleep is an
important symptom of some diseases of the brain otherwise it seldom
if ever occurs unless soothing sirups or other drugs have been given
exercise
is exercise important for infants
it is as necessary for them as for older children
how is it obtained
a young baby gets its exercise by screaming waving its arms kicking
etc the clothing should not be so tight as to make these movements
impossible at least twice a day the infant should be allowed for
fifteen or twenty minutes the free use of its limbs by permitting it
to lie upon a bed in a warm room with all clothing except the shirt
stockings and napkin removed later when in short clothes the baby
may be put upon a thick blanket or quilt laid upon the floor and be
allowed to tumble about at will a nursery fence two feet high made
to surround a mattress is an excellent device and makes a convenient
box stall for the young animal where it can learn to use both its
arms and legs without the danger of injury only by exercise such as
this do the muscles have an opportunity to develop properly
the cry
when is crying useful
in the newly born infant the cry expands the lungs and it is
necessary that it should be repeated for a few minutes every day in
order to keep them well expanded
how much crying is normal for a very young baby
from fifteen to thirty minutes a day is not too much
what is the nature of this cry
it is loud and strong infants get red in the face with it in fact
it is a scream this is necessary for health it is the babys
exercise
when is a cry abnormal
when it is too long or too frequent the abnormal cry is rarely
strong often it is a moaning or a worrying cry sometimes only a
feeble whine
what are the causes of such crying
pain temper hunger illness and habit
what is the cry of pain
it is usually strong and sharp but not generally continuous it is
accompanied by contraction of the features drawing up of the legs
and other symptoms of distress
what is the cry of hunger
it is usually a continuous fretful cry rarely strong and lusty
what is the cry of temper
it is loud and strong and accompanied by kicking or stiffening of the
body and is usually violent
what is the cry of illness
there is usually more of fretfulness and moaning than real crying
although crying is excited by very slight causes
what is the cry of indulgence or from habit
this is often heard even in very young infants who cry to be rocked
to be carried about sometimes for a light in the room for a bottle
to suck or for the continuance of any other bad habit which has been
acquired
how can we be sure that a child is crying to be indulged
if it stops immediately when it gets what it wants and cries when it
is withdrawn or withheld
what should be done if a baby cries at night
one should get up and see that the child is comfortablethe clothing
smooth under the body the hands and feet warm and the napkin not wet
or soiled if all these matters are properly adjusted and the child
simply crying to be taken up it should not be further interfered
with if the night cry is habitual some other cause should be sought
see page 121
how is an infant to be managed that cries from temper habit or to
be indulged
it should simply be allowed to cry it out this often requires an
hour and in extreme cases two or three hours a second struggle will
seldom last more than ten or fifteen minutes and a third will rarely
be necessary such discipline is not to be carried out unless one is
sure as to the cause of the habitual crying
is it likely that rupture will be caused from crying
not in young infants if the abdominal band is properly applied and
not after a year under any circumstances
lifting children
how should a young baby be lifted from its bed
the right hand should grasp the clothing below the feet and the left
hand should be slipped beneath the infants body to its head it is
then raised upon the left arm
what is the advantage of this
the entire spine is supported and no undue pressure is made upon the
chest or abdomen as often happens if the baby is grasped around the
body or under the arms
how should a child old enough to run about be lifted
always by placing the hands under the childs arms and never by the
wrists
what injury may be inflicted by lifting the child by the wrists or
hands
often serious injury is done to the elbow or shoulder joints
the temperature
what is the normal temperature of an infant
the normal temperature varies more than in adults in the rectum it
usually fluctuates between 98 and 995 f a rectal temperature of
975 f or of 1005 f is of no importance whatever unless it
continues
where should the temperature of infants and young children be taken
the rectum is altogether the best place and next to this the groin
the rectal temperature is from half a degree to a degree higher than
that in the groin
how long should the thermometer be left in place to take the
temperature
two minutes in the rectum and five minutes in the groin
is the temperature of a young child a good guide as to the severity
of its symptoms in illness
as a rule it is a temperature of 100 to 102 f commonly means a mild
illness and one of 104 f or over a serious one the duration of the
fever is however even more important than the height of the
temperature it should be remembered that in all young children slight
causes often produce a high temperature which lasts for a few hours
one should not therefore be unduly alarmed unless the temperature
continues high or is accompanied by other important signs of illness
is not a high temperature a more serious symptom in a young child
than in an adult
the opposite is rather the case young children are extremely
sensitive to conditions which produce fever and the thermometer often
gives an exaggerated idea of the severity of the symptoms a cause
which in an adult might produce a temperature of 102 f or 103 f
in a young child would very likely be accompanied by a temperature of
104 or 105 f
nervousness
what are the principal causes of excessive nervousness in infants and
young children and what can be done to prevent this
the most important cause is the delicate structure of the brain at
this time and its rapid growth it grows as much during the first
year as during all the rest of life this requires quiet and peaceful
surroundings infants who are naturally nervous should be left much
alone should see but few people should be played with very little
and should never be quieted with soothing sirups or the pacifier
at what age may playing with babies be begun
babies under six months old should never be played with and the less
of it at any time the better for the infant
what harm is done by playing with very young babies
they are made nervous and irritable sleep badly and suffer from
indigestion and in many other respects
when may young children be played with
if at all in the morning or after the midday nap but never just
before bedtime
toys
what points should guide one in selecting toys and playthings for an
infant
the instinct in a baby to put everything into the mouth is so strong
that nothing should be given that cannot be safely treated in this
way hence one should choose things which are smooth those which can
be easily washed and those which cannot be swallowed
one should avoid 1 toys with sharp points or corners 2 those with
loose parts that might be detached or broken off and swallowed 3
small objects which might be swallowed or pushed into the nose or ear
such as coins marbles and safetypins also beads and buttons unless
strung upon a stout cord 4 painted toys 5 those covered with
hair or wool infants have often been severely injured by swallowing
what they have pulled off from their small toy animals
what points are to be considered in selecting the toys and playthings
of a child over two years old
it should be remembered that toys are not merely a source of
amusement but that they have an educational value as well those are
therefore to be preferred the use of which develops the childs
imagination and with which he can be taught to amuse himself for
boys nothing can surpass blocks toy soldiers balls engines and
cars and for girls dolls and housekeeping sets the complicated
mechanical toys now so much in vogue give only a momentary pleasure
and as soon as the wonder at their operation has worn off they have
lost interest for the child except that which he gets in breaking them
to see how the thing worked
what important things can be taught children with their toys and how
may this be done
the imagination may be developed and children may be trained to
habits of neatness order and regularity and to concentration of mind
to this end toys should be kept in an orderly way upon a shelf in the
nursery or in a closet never piled in a miscellaneous heap in the
corner of the room children should select their toys and play with
one thing at a time which they should be taught to put away in its
place before another is given they should never be allowed to have a
dozen things strewn about the room at one time with none of which
they are occupied
kissing
are there any valid objections to kissing infants
there are many serious objections tuberculosis diphtheria and many
other grave diseases may be communicated in this way the kissing of
infants upon the mouth by other children by nurses or by people
generally should under no circumstances be permitted infants should
be kissed if at all upon the cheek or forehead but the less even of
this the better
convulsions
what should be done for a child in convulsions before a doctor
arrives
keep the child perfectly quiet with ice at the head put the feet in a
mustard bath and roll the entire body in large towels which have been
dipped in mustard water two heaping tablespoonfuls of mustard to one
quart of tepid water and have plenty of hot water and a bath tub at
hand so that the doctor can give a hot bath if he thinks it
advisable
when is a hot bath useful
if the convulsions have continued until the pulse is weak the face
very pale the nails and lips blue and the feet and hands cold the
hot bath will be useful by bringing blood to the surface and relieving
the heart lungs and brain
how should the bath be given
the temperature should not be over 106 f this should always be
tested by a thermometer if one can be obtained without this
precaution in the excitement of the moment infants have frequently
been put into baths so hot that serious and even fatal burns have been
produced if no thermometer is available the nurse may plunge her arm
to the elbow into the water it should feel warm but not so hot as to
be at all uncomfortable one half a teacupful of powdered mustard
added to the bath often adds to its efficacy
foreign bodies
what should be done if a foreign body has been swallowed
first examine the throat with the finger to see if it has lodged
there and if so remove it if it has passed from the throat it has
usually gone into the stomach
what should be done in this case
give the child plenty of dry food like bread potato etc but under
no circumstances either an emetic or cathartic an infant may have its
usual food
what harm would a cathartic do
it is likely to hurry the foreign body too rapidly through the
intestine and in this way do harm otherwise it becomes coated with
fecal matter and passes the intestine usually without doing injury
what should be done if a child gets a foreign body into the ear
unless this can easily be removed with the fingers it should not be
meddled with for it is likely to be pushed farther into the ear the
child should be taken to a physician
what should be done if there is a foreign body in the nose
the child should blow his nose strongly while the empty nostril is
compressed unless this removes it a physician should be called
meddlesome interference is always harmful
colic
what are the symptoms of colic
there is a strong hard cry which comes suddenly and returns every
few minutes with this there is drawing up of the feet contraction of
the muscles of the face and other signs of pain the abdomen is
usually tense and hard
what should be done for a baby with colic
first see that the feet are warm place them against a hotwater bag
or hold them before an open fire apply a hot flannel to the abdomen
or let the child lie upon its stomach across a hotwater bag if the
colic continues a half teacupful of warm water containing ten drops
of turpentine may be injected into the bowels with a syringe at the
same time the abdomen should be gently rubbed so as to start the wind
if the gas is in the stomach half of a soda mint tablet may be given
in a tablespoonful of very warm water
earache
what are the symptoms of earache
the pain is generally severe and accompanied by a sharp scream the
child often puts the hand to the affected ear or cries whenever it is
touched the pain is likely to be prolonged and continuous
how should a child with earache be treated
the ear should be irrigated with a solution of boric acid twenty
grains to the ounce as warm as can be borne dry heat may then be
applied in several ways the ear having been first covered with
cotton a small hotwater bag or one filled with hot salt or bran may
be bound over it with a bandage or a small butter plate heated in hot
water may be used in the same way the hotwater bag may be held
against the ear or the child may lie with his head upon it the use of
such substances as oil and laudanum in the ear is not to be
recommended
croup
what are the symptoms of croup
there is a hollow dry barking cough with some difficulty in
breathing
when is this likely to come on
usually at night
is simple croup dangerous
the ordinary croup of infants is spasmodic croup and is very rarely
dangerous although the symptoms seem very alarming
what are the symptoms
in a mild attack there is simply noisy breathing especially on
drawing in the breath with a tight barking or croupy cough in a
severe attack the childs breathing is more noisy and becomes
difficult
what is the dangerous form of croup
membranous croup which is the same thing as diphtheria of the larynx
how does this develop
gradually very rarely does it come on suddenly
what should be done for a baby who has spasmodic croup
the room should be very warm hot cloths or poultices should be
applied over the throat and either a croup kettle or an ordinary
teakettle kept boiling in the room this is more efficacious if the
child is placed in a tent made by a raised umbrella with a sheet
thrown over it and the steam introduced beneath the tent if the
symptoms are urgent ten drops of the sirup of ipecac should be given
every fifteen minutes until free vomiting occurs whenever the
symptoms reach a point where breathing becomes difficult a doctor
should be summoned without delay
contagious diseases
what are the first symptoms of measles
measles comes on rather gradually with cough sneezing watery eyes
and nose much like an ordinary cold in the head the eruption appears
after three or four days first upon the face and neck as small red
spots and spreads slowly over the body
is measles a serious disease
in infants and during the winter season it is likely to be very
serious on account of the danger of bronchitis and pneumonia which
frequently accompany it in children over four years old it is
generally not severe no child should be voluntarily exposed to this
disease and particularly one who is delicate or prone to disease of
the lungs should be protected against it
when and how is measles contagious
measles may readily be conveyed from the very beginning of the
catarrh two or three days before any eruption is present it is not
often carried by healthy persons its poison does not cling long to a
sick room
what is german measles
german measles or rubella is a distinct disease and has nothing to
do with ordinary measles it is extremely rare for a child to be much
sick with it there is usually a very extensive eruption which may
cover the body but few other symptoms
what are the first symptoms of scarlet fever
generally it comes suddenly with vomiting high fever and sore
throat the eruption usually appears within twentyfour hours as a red
blush first upon the neck and chest and spreads rapidly
when and how is scarlet fever contagious
scarlet fever is only slightly contagious for the first one or two
days of the attack it is most contagious at the height of the disease
and during desquamation it may be carried by healthy persons and by
the clothing or bedding from the sick room
how does whoopingcough begin
for a week or ten days it cannot be distinguished from an ordinary
cold on the chest then the attacks of coughing gradually become more
severe and vomiting may follow after a severe coughing fit the breath
is caught with a peculiar noise known as the whoop
how does chickenpox begin
it usually comes out gradually as widely scattered pimples over the
scalp face and body many of which soon become small vesicles
resembling tiny blisters there is itching and local discomfort but
little fever and the child rarely seems to be very ill
how does diphtheria begin
sometimes suddenly but usually gradually with sore throat and
swelling of the glands of the neck with white patches upon the
tonsils or a free discharge which may be bloody from the nostrils
how does mumps begin
as a swelling upon the jaw beneath the ear as it increases it
extends forward upon the cheek and backward behind the ear it affects
one or both sides
mumps is not very common in young children and in them it is usually
mild after twelve or thirteen years it is likely to be more severe
how long after exposure do the first symptoms appear in the different
diseases
in scarlet fever in from three to five days rarely later than a week
in measles in from nine to fourteen days occasionally as late as
twenty days in whoopingcough in from one to two weeks in
chickenpox in from fourteen to sixteen days in german measles in
from ten to sixteen days in diphtheria the time varies much it may
be only one day and it may be one or two weeks in mumps it is
usually a little less than three weeks the average being twenty days
which of these diseases are most contagious
measles and chickenpox are very contagious and very few children who
have not had them can come near a person suffering from either disease
without taking it whoopingcough is almost as contagious as measles
and for young babies even more so a very close exposure is not
necessary in the case of either of these diseases and whoopingcough
can undoubtedly be contracted in the open air scarlet fever and
diphtheria are much less contagious for both of these a pretty close
exposure is necessary
how long should a child with any of these diseases be kept away from
other children
with measles for two weeks after the rash has gone with scarlet
fever for at least four weeks after the rash has gone and longer if
the peeling is not over or if the ears are running with
whoopingcough for two months or so long as the paroxysmal cough
continues with chickenpox until all crusts have fallen off or for
about three weeks after the eruption appears with german measles for
one week after the eruption has faded with diphtheria at least ten
days after the throat is well in a very mild case and four weeks if
the case has been severe with mumps for one week after the swelling
has gone
what should be done when a child shows the first symptoms of serious
illness
the child should be put to bed if it is an infant the food should be
diluted to one half the usual strength if an older child only fluid
food should be given if the child seems feverish take the
temperature if the bowels are constipated give a teaspoonful of
castor oil but no other medicine without the doctors orders send
for the doctor at once and until he comes carefully exclude all other
children from the room
by what nursery training may the examination and treatment of sick
children he made much easier
by teaching all children to gargle to show the throat to take pills
and by constantly teaching them to regard the doctor as the childs
best friend and his visits as a great treat on no account should a
child be frightened into obedience by threats of what the doctor will
do
with care and patience most children may be taught to gargle and take
pills at four or five years and to show the throat willingly at two
or three all these matters should be made a part of the childs
education
scurvy
what is scurvy and how is it produced
scurvy is a disease of general nutrition usually caused by the
longcontinued use of improper food most of the cases come from the
use of the prepared infants foods sold in the stores especially when
they are given without fresh milk occasionally the use of condensed
milk and of sterilized milk is followed by scurvy sometimes it is
seen when owing to feeble digestion it has been necessary to make
cows milk very weak for a long time
what symptoms are seen in an infant with scurvy
at first there is only indefinite and occasional soreness in the legs
so that the child cries out when handled as this soreness becomes
more severe the child is often thought to have rheumatism the gums
swell and are of a deep purple colour there may be bleeding from the
gums nose bowels or blackandblue spots may be seen upon the legs
the ankles and knees may swell the child grows very pale loses
appetite and weight and sleeps badly
what should be done when an infant shows signs of scurvy
the diet should at once be changed to fresh milk properly modified
according to the childs digestion but not sterilized or pasteurized
the juice of a sweet orange should be given best about an hour before
the feeding at first one or two teaspoonfuls four or five times a
day later more may be given if the symptoms are not improved
properly treated an infant with scurvy generally recovers promptly and
completely if not recognised or untreated it may cause death
constipation
when it is necessary to move the bowels immediately what are some of
the easiest methods
an injection of one tablespoonful of sweet oil may be given or half a
teaspoonful of glycerine in one tablespoonful of water or a teacupful
of tepid soap and water or a glycerine suppository none of these
should be continued excepting under the physicians directions
what sort of a syringe is to be preferred for giving an injection to
an infant
the bulb syringe is the simplest this consists of an oval bulb of
soft rubber and a soft rubber or a hard rubber tip it holds one or
two ounces
what is the most essential thing in preventing or overcoming
constipation
the formation of the habit of having the bowels move every day
regularly at the same hour and proper early training see page 156
what is the best hour
in most cases immediately after the first meal in the morning
what are some simple means by which constipation may be relieved
the best are diet suppositories and massage
the changes to be made in the milk of constipated infants have been
mentioned on page 82 the addition to the milk of some of the malted
foods such as mellins food or malted milk is sometimes useful for
little children the fruit juices are particularly beneficial when
given half an hour or more before the first morning feeding with half
a glass of water
for older children the amount of white bread toast and potato
should be reduced and green vegetables oatmeal and graham bread
given with plenty of fruit twice a day raw scraped apples are
sometimes of more value than any other fruit
the best suppositories for continuous use are probably the gluten
suppositories of the health food company one should be given the
first thing in the morning they act rather slowly usually in about
two hours in obstinate cases one may also be used at bedtime
glycerine suppositories act more quickly but are too irritating for
regular use
massage consists in rubbing the abdomen which may be done in one of
two ways beginning at the right groin the hand is carried up to the
ribs then across to the opposite side then around to the left groin
the abdomen is stroked gently at first and afterward deeper pressure
used as the child becomes accustomed to it the second method is by
rubbing the deeper parts with a circular movementthe fingers not
moving upon the skinmaking a series of small circles beginning at
the right groin and following the same course as described above
either method should be employed for six or eight minutes twice a day
at almost any regular time except soon after a meal
diarrhoea
in case a child is taken with diarrhoea what should be done
with a moderate looseness of the bowels in an older child solid food
should be stopped and boiled milk given diluted with gruel the child
should be kept perfectly quiet as walking about always aggravates
such a disturbance if the symptoms are more severe and attended by
fever and vomiting all milk should be stopped at once and only
broth barley water or some thin gruel given some cathartic usually
castor oil is required with a severe attack
if the patient is an infant the milk should be diluted and especially
should the fat be reduced see page 76 in severe attacks with
vomiting or frequent foul stools all food should be stopped for at
least twelve hours and all milk for a longer time and the bowels
freely moved by a cathartic
why is a cathartic necessary if the movements are already frequent
such movements are nearly always due to an irritation in the bowel
set up by the fermenting food which has not been digested the
diarrhoea is natures effort to get rid of the irritant nothing to
stop the movements should be given until the bowels have been
thoroughly cleared by the treatment mentioned
bad habits
what are the most common bad habits of young children
sucking nailbiting dirteating bedwetting and masturbation
what do children suck
most frequently the thumbs or fingers sometimes the clothing or
blanket often the pacifier or rubber nipple
when is this habit most frequently seen
it begins in quite early infancy and if not broken may last until
children are six or seven years old
is the sucking habit a harmful one
when persisted in it may produce a misshapen mouth or fingers it
constantly stimulates the flow of saliva and certainly aggravates
disturbances of digestion during which the sucking habit is likely to
be practised it may lead to thrush or other forms of infection of the
mouth it is not necessary as a means of quieting a child though it
may in some degree cover up the consequences of bad feeding or bad
training on no account should the habit of sucking the pacifier be
allowed as a means of putting children to sleep or of quieting them
while restless from dentition or indigestion
how is the sucking habit to be controlled
one should be sure in the first place that the constant sucking of
fingers is not due to hunger from insufficient food sucking of the
hands may often be controlled by wearing mittens or fastening the
hands to the sides during sleep in more obstinate cases it may be
necessary to confine the elbow by small pasteboard splints to prevent
the child from bending the arm so as to get the hand to the mouth
when are nailbiting and dirteating seen and how are they to be
controlled
these habits belong especially to children over three years old they
are seen particularly in those who are excessively nervous or whose
general health is below par sometimes in those who develop serious
nervous diseases later in life children with such tendencies should
be closely watched and every means used to break up these habits
early dirteating is a morbid craving which is rarely seen in a
normal child
at what age may a child generally be expected to go without wetting
the bed during the night
usually at two and a half years if it is taken up late in the
evening some children acquire control of the bladder at night when
two years old and a few not until three years after three years
habitual bedwetting is abnormal
how should a young child addicted to bedwetting be managed
at three or four years of age punishments are sometimes useful
especially when it seems to depend more upon the childs indifference
than anything else they are of no value in older children rewards
being much more efficacious in all cases one should give a child
plenty of milk and water early in the day but no fluids after 4 pm
the supper being always of solid or semisolid food the child
should be taken up regularly at ten oclock or thereabouts it often
happens that the formation or continuance of the habit is due to the
child being in poor general condition to some irritation in the
urine or in the genital organs unless the simple means mentioned are
successful the child should be placed under the charge of a physician
what is masturbation
it is the habit of rubbing the genital organs with the hands with the
clothing against the bed or rubbing the thighs together sometimes
the child sits upon the floor crosses its thighs tightly and rocks
backward and forward many of these things are passed over lightly and
are regarded for months as simply a queer trick of the child it may
be seen at any age even in those not more than a year old and in
both sexes
how should such a child be treated
masturbation is the most injurious of all the bad habits and should
be broken up just as early as possible children should especially be
watched at the time of going to sleep and on first waking punishments
and mechanical restraint are of little avail except with infants with
older children they usually make matters worse rewards are much more
efficacious it is of the utmost importance to watch the child
closely to keep his confidence and by all possible means to teach
selfcontrol
some local cause of irritation is often present which can be removed
medical advice should at once be sought
vaccination
nowadays when smallpox occurs so seldom is it necessary to have
every child vaccinated
it should by all means be done it is only by the practice of general
vaccination that smallpox is kept down in countries or in
communities where vaccination is neglected frightful outbreaks of
smallpox occur every now and then just as in olden times
what is the best time for vaccination
the time usually selected is from the third to the sixth month it may
be deferred in a very delicate child who is not likely to be exposed
to smallpox or in a child suffering from any form of skin disease
which is preferable for vaccination the arm or the leg
the part which can be most easily protected and kept at rest is to be
chosen in infants who do not yet walk or creep the leg is to be
preferred in older children in most circumstances the arm if older
children are vaccinated on the leg they should not be allowed to walk
much while the vaccination is active
when should vaccination be repeated
an unsuccessful vaccination proves nothing and should be repeated in
two or three weeks if success fully vaccinated in infancy a child
should invariably be revaccinated before puberty if exposed or likely
to be exposed to smallpox at any time vaccination should be repeated
