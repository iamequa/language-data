lennox says goodbye
i had just made my rounds of the wards for the last time that june
evening fifteen years ago when murchison my chief came to me with
the open letter in his hand
heres the very chance to suit you haverill he said  read that
a chap named lennox in pennsylvania wants a substitute for three
months  small country practiceno work of any account i
imagineand a good holiday thrown in  just reached me tonight by
chance
i had finished my term as interne and was leaving the hospital the
next day  the whole summer was before me for after three years of
heavy work i owed myself one good vacation before settling to the
task of building up a private practice and i was glad enough of the
chance to turn it to advantage  every dollar i had saved i had put
aside for the future struggle and murchison knew it  how to take a
three months vacation on next to nothing was no easy problem and
only such an opportunity as this for which i had been searching
vainly for weeks past could solve it
i glanced at the signature below the letter
george lennox  i used to know a george lennox at college
probably the same man  he asks me to recommend some one reliable
funny idea  he cant have much opinion of his country colleagues or
hed simply hand the patients over  there cant be so many of them
in a place like that  rather fussy i gather  well it might suit
you  i thought id ask you before i spoke to anyone else
it suited me so well in prospect that i sat down at murchisons
desk and wrote off my application then and there  lennoxs answer
came promptly dated from the small town in pennsylvania where he had
been settled for the past five years  beyond a few details about the
place his letter told me very little  he was leaving for his
health to take a three months holiday abroad and he wanted a
substitute as early as possible  the practice was that of the
average country doctor in a not overpopulous neighbourhood  it was
a bracing district not far from the mountains there was good
fishing and some shooting in the fall and with the arrangements he
offered it fell in perfectly with my own plans  he was urgent that i
should take over the work as soon as i could and after a brief
correspondence i settled up my affairs in the citythey were not
manypacked my few belongings and went down
it was a small and primitive station at which i was deposited after
a somewhat uninteresting train journey  the place struck me even in
those days as a survival of an earlier age one of those little
backwaters left behind in the flow of progress  as i stood looking
about me at the stretch of dusty road the hotel and the few
clustered shops that marked the beginning of the village street the
stationmaster came up
youre for doctor lennox aint you he began  his buggys there
waitin  i reckon petes over at the saloon puttin in time  ill
step over an tell him
i put my valise in the solitary vehicle he indicated with a smart
roan mare in the shafts and a moment later pete appeared drawing
a furtive black hand over his mouth  i addressed him curtly if he
was to be my factotum during the next three months there would have
to be less of these rather freeandeasy ways  he eyed me civilly
with some curiosity muttering a darkies invariable ready excuses
climbed to the buggy seat tilting his straw hat over his eyes and
we set off
the village was not large  it seemed that lennoxs place was some
mile and a half out and our road led for the most part through
woods  it was pretty country  the trees were tall and
closegrowing hickory and oak with young saplings pushing a sturdy
growth between  there were boulders everywhere the sullen granite
that in this district crops out through the earths scant surface
making the small farmers life a perpetual harvest of stone picking
to me fresh from the city pavements it was picturesque enough
once a hare loped across our path and i saw pete shift the reins to
scrabble in his coat pocket  he cast a halfsheepish glance at me as
he did so
have you lost something i asked
no sah  i jest recollected suthin  raikon dat hyar remin me
meeting a rabbit is supposed to be lucky isnt it i remarked
lighting a cigarette  it seems to me ive heard so
he looked at me suspiciously and i knew that i had divined correctly
the reason of that sudden dive  dat so sah he said guilelessly
i spect all dem things jes depend
a few yards further the road took a bend
along the narrow footpath at the side a girl was walking  she was
dressed in a short golfskirt and cotton blouse with a mans panama
on her head and from her look i took her for a chance summer visitor
rather than a resident  i noticed her only casually but as the
buggy drew abreast she lifted her head and instantly i felt pete
swerve against me on the seat  his clumsy action made the horse
start  the girl laughed a little mocking ripplei heard her with a
glow of annoyanceand we shot off at increased pace up the road
i turned to the man angrily he had drunk even more than i supposed
his face was actually pale as pale as a darkies can be  his hand
was in his pocket again and he turned my blame promptly on the horse
yoh clumsy trash ain yoh look whar yoh goin askeerin folks that
way  ise larn yoh suthin some day
whats the matter with you i said  cant you drive steadily
he fell to muttering apologetic conciliatory
deed sah dat hoss ain got no sainse  i done druv dat hoss two
years an i know her sah  dere ain no hoss round got less
sainse  sho as we met dat hyar i knew there was suthin boun ter
happen  i ain got no use fur meetin hyars in de mawninno sah
i ain doin no business wiv em
we reached lennoxs house without further incident  it was a grey
stone house standing back in a pleasant garden with barn and small
orchard adjoining  lennox was out on the porch to welcome me  pete
led the mare swiftly round to the side and began to unharness i
think he was anxious to escape any possible comment i might make to
the doctor on his condition
well so youve got here lennox said as we shook hands  im very
glad  did you have a tiresome journey  come inside  im very glad
to see you
his tone was cordiality itself  to my ears it had even a note of
relief  it struck me instantly as i looked at him that he had been
through some recent stress of worry if not illhealth  he had aged
considerably  he was older than i and his hair already a little
grey at the temples  his face was lined and troubled and he had an
uneasy way with his hands i did not like  i had known him always as
a rather steadygoing plodding sort of fellow not given to excess
of nervous energy in any form and his present appearance gave me
something of a shock
he led the way into the house  dinner was already served  lennox
followed the country custom in dining early  i dont know how the
staid elderly woman who was both cook and housekeeper and who was
to fulfil the same offices for me would take to such an innovation
as dinner at seven  i ate well after my journey lennox but
sparingly  he offered me a high ball with the meal but drank only
water himself
ive got into country ways he said  im afraid youll find the
place a bit dull haverill but youll manage all right  you can get
most things you want down here the tradespeople arent bad
over our meal we talked chiefly of the university days when we had
been more or less friends though lennox was already a senior when i
entered of the men we had mutually known and of their careers and
lightly only of our own  lennox was not overtalkative but he
seemed more at ease as the day wore on  i could see he was glad to
have me definitely there was anxious to start but i was not quite
prepared for his answer when i asked him what day he thought of
leaving
oh tomorrow  i shall get the twelvethirty to the city
everything is ready
i suppose i looked rather blank for i had counted on a couple of
days at least in his company before i was left alone
youll find everything easy to hand  ill go over things with you
this evening  it isnt a specially busy place here you know
and youll be away three months i asked
more or less  my dear fellow i want a change  i want it
frightfully  i agreed with him  his eyes were wandering round the
room as he spoke  the works nothing hereworse luck  youll have
practically a holiday  but im quite run down  thereve been some
 some family worries  whats the matter pete
the coloured man had come into the room
de mares done got anudder shoe loose  i specs ill hev to take
her into town
again  you should have had it seen to this morning early  he
spoke irritably  take her in and dont be late back
yessah
pete went out lingeringly and i more than suspected from his entry
that he had been listening or attempting to listen to our talk
that man i said when he had gone  do you find him all right
pete  lennox lit a cigar  hes invaluable  youll find him a
splendid servant  hes been with me three years and i wouldnt part
with him for a good deal  he has his faults as all darkies have
but hes thoroughly trustworthy
i thought of the furtive groping in his pocket when we passed the
hare
a bit superstitious eh
what do you mean lennox fairly wheeled on me  has he been
talking
i imagine he carries an assortment of amulets about with him
oh that  he looked vaguely relieved  all of em do  hes a
walking catalogue of superstitions  its the only thing we have rows
about  i detest all that nonsense
ill have a talk with him some day i said
i wouldnt advise you to  in fact i wouldnt advise you to
encourage him on the subject in any way  i think its better to
leave those things alone  darkies are darkies and no power on earth
would persuade pete against his rabbits foot  no  steer clear of
that my dear fellow and youll find him all right
we spent the afternoon in the surgery  lennox showed me a detailed
account of his casesthey were very fewin a notebook  he had
evidently been at pains that i should find no trouble in taking over
the work
ive left some things in rather a mess he said  i told you id
been upset lately  but i think youll find it all right
supper was at six  pete true to his word brought the mare back
well before dusk  i could hear him whistling in the coachhouse as
he hung the harness away
i suppose youd find use for a motorcycle here i asked lennox as
we sat in the diningroom after supper  it was barely dark outside
but the housekeeper had already drawn the curtains and lighted the
lamp  i would have infinitely preferred my pipe on the porch but if
lennox chose to stew indoors this weather it was no business of mine
and it would only be forced on me for one evening
i used to have one he said but i gave it up  the roads arent
very good here and i found a horse better  did you bring one
its coming on tomorrow
oh  well youll suit yourself  the roads arent very good at
night but the mare is used to them  not that i have many night
calls
it was a few minutes after that he looked at me suddenly as we sat
opposite one another across the unlighted hearth
i suppose youre fitin good health and all that  i didnt ask
perfectly
thats good  never had any nerve trouble for instance
not an atom
im glad  its as well to be sure you know  he laughed rather
apologetically  i was quite lucky to get you
it seemed that lennox kept early hours  it was barely halfpast ten
when he proposed turning in  the heavy country air had made me
sleepy and i was ready enough to follow his lead
lennoxs room was directly over the surgery with which it
communicated by a little staircase convenient for night calls  both
the surgery and the room above it had been built as a later addition
to the house  the bedroom would be mine later for the present i was
put into a small extra bedroom across the landing from his own
i slept heavily but a little after midnight as i judged i was
roused by hearing movements below stairs  people were talking i
fancied i heard a womans voice low and querulous  evidently it was
not a call too urgent to wait for daylight for a few moments later i
heard the floor of lennoxs room creak as he returned to bed  i fell
asleep again easily and when i woke the second time it was broad
daylight
i asked lennox at breakfast if there was any fresh call for the day
he looked at me narrowly
only the scarlatina case in the village and the woman at the bend
he said referring to the two cases he had mentioned the day before
the woman is doing all right but you might look in during the
afternoon  the buggy will be back by one oclock
i smoked a pipe out in the orchard while he finished his packing  no
one came up the road the whole morning except the baker and a
travelling tinsmith lennox was right when he said i could take my
work easily  the house stood in a pretty enough position  there
were woods behind and about skirting the orchard and in front on
the other side of the road a strip of pasture sloped to a little
brook  the nearest dwelling was some two hundred yards away down
the road to the village  it belonged to a small farmer i learned a
pennsylvania dutchman as were most of the people about
at twelve the mare was hitched and waiting and lennox came to bid me
goodbye after a few final instructions  we shook hands and as he
climbed into the buggy and took up the reins i dont think i ever saw
a mans face express more utter and absolute relief
ii
the light in the woods
my first week passed uneventfully  i was called out twice only on
trivial cases and i put in my spare time exploring the neighbourhood
generally  i was jaded with city life and hospital work in
particular and it was a perfect tonic to do nothing  i was too lazy
even to fish though an excellent trout stream ran not far from the
house through the woods at the back  neighbours were not likely to
trouble me nor i them  so far i had had but little intercourse with
the people about except for professional visits and the usual
country exchange of greetings when i drove into the town for my mail
in lennoxs time this task had fallen to peter but it was some years
since i had enjoyed the use of a horse and i took pleasure in these
short trips
the housekeeper was subdued but efficient she looked after my wants
methodically enough and rarely offered conversation which suited me
with peter i got on all right  as lennox had said he was docile
willing and capable and did his work reliably  he seemed devoted to
the mare and would converse with her at great length over the
morning grooming
lennox had a fairly good library  in ways the house was comfortable
enough and i fancy he must have had some small private income in
addition to the proceeds of his practice
i had my first tiff with pete when i had been there nearly a
fortnight  kerosene had given out the oilman had omitted to call as
usual and mrs searle the housekeeper only made me aware of the
deficiency at suppertime  after the meal i ordered peter to hitch
up and drive down to the village to get it
to my utter amazement he refused almost pointblank to go  he had a
lot of work to do the buggy wasnt washed down yet the mare hadnt
finished her feed  hed go first thing in the morning
nonsense pete i said  the oils wanted now  the mare hasnt
done five miles today and itll do her good  you washed the buggy
this afternoon because i saw you
dat so sah  he rubbed his head  yes i specs dats so now i
think  i disremembered it
then hurry up  you can be back by eight
his eyes rolled on me
but it done get dark by eight sah
well you can take the carriage lamps
i aint gwine take no kerridge lampsno sah  all de time i wuk
fur doc lennox he ain ask me to do no thing like thatno sah an
ef he ask me now i ain gwine do it
but youve driven the doctor at night you fool time and again i
cried losing patience with him  dont stand there and tell me
lies
he kept his ground obstinate deferential
yessir i done druv doc lennox  i ain sayin nothin bout that
ise gwine drive you doctah ef yoh ask me but i ain gwine no
village affer dark tonight ter git no kersine  i ain gwine
monkeyin wi no haants an i dwant no haants monkeyin wid me
that potent darkie word haants gave me a clue  i strode out into
the kitchen to mrs searle
whats this nonsense with peter  what is he afraid of i asked her
mrs searles grey faded eyes rested on me a moment inquisitively
then she went on with her dishwashing
i reckon peters scared of the dark sir she answered civilly
them niggers is jest like that  the oil can wait as well as not
theres moren i thought or i wouldnt have mentioned it to you
it isnt going to wait i said  im not going to have this
absurdity in any house i live in
i went back to pete in the diningroom  i had left the doors
purposely open and i swear he fairly squirmed when he saw me come in
now pete i said  you put the mare in at once  youre going
after that oil and im going with you if youre such a holy coward
that youre afraid to drive a mile of road after dark alone
if i had hoped to shame him it was without result
all right sah he answered grandly though i saw the relief in his
eyes  ef youse gwine ise gwine  dey ain no one gwine call me
no cowad doctah
he went off to put the mare in and in ten minutes i heard the grate
of wheels before the house  it was already dark outside but a moon
was rising and before we had driven far the carriage lamps were
scarcely needed  pete was subdued i think he was trying to preserve
his dignity in silence  i was tempted to a lecture but remembered
what lennox had said of the futility of trying to combat darkie
superstition  i was sure that pete still carried his beloved rabbit
foot and i hope it gave him comfort on the drive
we reached the village took in our can of oil which pete stowed
under the buggy seat and started to drive back  the moon was full
overhead now but obscured more or less by fleeting clouds  i saw
pete glancing several times at the buggy lamps  presently he
slackened the reins a little
i reckon we mought put dem out now sah  dey ain no need er dem
lamps to see by
as you like pete  get down and put them out  ill hold the reins
i aint got no need er gittin out sah  i kin raich em from here
he leaned over the splashboard at some inconvenience and extinguished
the lamps it seemed to me with unnecessary alacrity  i could not
put his anxiety down altogether to the price of kerosene
whats your worry about those lamps pete i asked
he turned guileless yet uneasy eyes upon me
dey jest ain no sainse burnin em  dey worry a pusson drivin
dem lamps do
i let it go as one of his unplumbed darkie mysteries and we drove
on  we were just entering upon the densest stretch of wood between
the house and the village when a curious sound caught my ears  it
was like the scrambling rush of some big bird through the trees to
the left of us a nighthawk probably though the confused
wingflaps were more like a turkeybuzzard  coming unexpectedly on
the silence it startled me but before i could turn to pete he had
dropped the reins and flung himself upon me a frenzied babbling
lump  he clung and muttered while i strove to hold him off and the
mare taking fright at the moment sent the light buggy rocking from
side to side on the road  i gave the man a push that nearly threw
him out  once free of his clutch it was only a moments work to
secure the reins but we shaved a bad accident by the skin of our
teeth  luckily we were not far from the house  my grip startled
pete into sanityit was at least flesh and blood that had him
thereand by the time i had pulled the mare to a standstill before
the gate he was able to get out shaking still miserably from head to
foot and seize the bridle
between us we got the mare unharnessed and into the stable  she was
in a lather over head and shoulders and i stood over the cringing
pete while he rubbed her down  i think he never ceased praying the
whole time
whatever the noise was that had frightened himand i put it down to
no worse than an owl at the mostit had frightened him thoroughly
there was no use attempting reason or rebuke with the abject
toothchattering being that followed me to the house and i sent him
to bed with a grim reminder that i would talk to him on the morrow
he did not go up immediately however  for a long while i heard his
voice in confabulation with mrs searle in the kitchen where i did
not doubt he had made haste to secure every door and window against
the outside air
i lit a pipe and threw myself down in an armchair in the surgery
where i had been in the habit of spending the last few evenings
putting things to rights after my own fashion  if petes
superstition was going to obsess him to this extent my summer was
likely to be a lively one  no bird that ever flew was sufficient to
justify the extraordinary state into which he had thrown himself
whiskey might be at the root of it despite lennoxs faith i had
kept him under my eye in the village but i knew that no human
vigilance is sharp enough to keep a darkle from drink if he has the
tendency  the sideboard was usually unlocked but tomorrow i
determined to take the key into my own possession
wanting something to read and to lazy to go back into the
sittingroom i fell to examining the contents of the surgery
bookshelves  there were the usual array of medical books some new
some old apparently lennox had kept himself more or less up to date
at one end on the upper shelf were several volumes on mental
diseases lunacy and its causes hoffmans congenital insanity
and one or two recent pathological treatises that i knew only by
title  there was a wellknown medical work on criminology among them
also and from their number and disposition and the several paper
bookmarks that caught my eye here and there i judged that this
particular study must have had some attraction for lennox  there was
nothing however that interested me for the moment or that promised
cheerful reading  i had not come down here to dive into works on
mental disorders or the bound reports of lunacy commissions as
preliminary to passing a healthful holiday and i fell back on a
monthold magazine that was lying on the surgery table
when i had finished it i turned the lamp slightly down and went out
on the porch with the idea of trying to locate again the noise that
had caused such catastrophe that evening
the woods about were very still not a leaf moved  the silence had
an intensity that was almost oppressive  clouds had gathered
obscuring the moon and it was quite dark
presently above the line of the farther treetops a gleam of light
shot up  it moved and swept like a white arm outstretched against a
black curtain  so near as i could judge it came from the direction
of sliefers dam a point some two miles away and at first glimpse i
thought it might be a fire but the whiteness of it put that out of
the question  it had the appearance of a crude searchlight but it
was less definite in ray and moved less steadily  more than anything
else it reminded me of those jackies that children love to make
with a bit of prism refracted on a wall
for several minutes i watched it then as suddenly it was
extinguished twitching back into darkness and i turned and went
indoors
iii
a mysterious call
i had prepared a stern lecture for pete while i was shaving next
morning but i was destined not to give it  while i was yet in my
room mrs searle called me from below stairs
youre wanted over to the bend doctor for mr lessing
i finished my dressing quickly and went downstairs  coffee was on
the table  mrs searle sniffed as she set a cup before me
youd best take something to eat before you start doctor  its a
twonahalfmile drive
who is this mr lessing  did they say what it was for
i fancied she looked at me rather curiously
he has the new bungalow in the woods there  its just before the
turnin to sliefers dam
she spoke as though with a reluctance to name either the house or its
owner and there flashed across my mind instantly a remembrance of
the first day peter had driven me to the bend a few clustered
cottages hardly enough to be called a village situated some few
miles up the road  we had passed near the house then just visible
through the trees and i had asked him who lived there  he had
answered with the same reluctance i traced in mrs searles reply
evidently this mr lessing had for some reason managed to make
himself unpopular in the district
peter had the buggy ready and i started off  the mare was fresher
than usual this morning and covered the two and a half miles at a
brisk pace
the road ran level for some distance then dipped to the little
hollow known as dutchmans hollow where it crossed a shallow stream
nearly dry in the summer  at the top of the hill when you had
crossed the stream was the turning to the new bungalow
the woods were emerald with early sunlight and the dew hung heavily
on brambles and undergrowth  birds were everywhere and i saw a
baltimore oriole a rare flash of black and orange fly across my
path as we neared the stream  above the marshy space at the foot of
the hollow many dragonflies were glancing jewelled and wonderful
and a small spotted turtle flopped from his stone in midstream at the
near crunch of wheels
i let the mare take her own pace climbing the hill  the morning was
too fine for hurry even on an unknown errand  when we reached the
top a glint of unpainted timber through the trees led me to the left
and a few yards up the crossroad i came out on a little clearing in
which the house stood
it was an ordinary onestory cottage newly built and as yet with no
attempt at garden or enclosure  what struck my eye immediately was a
curious sort of annex standing near it  it was a rather high
square building windowless but with one big skylight like an
artists studio  yet it had not the look of a studio and the
skylight was so raised on four glass sides as to suggest a rude
attempt at an observatory
i tied the mare to a sapling in the shade and went up to the house
the front door stood open and the interior showed the usual
livingroom of a summer cottage  it was furnished scantily but
artistically  there were a few good rugs on the floor a divan
heaped with cushions a piano and a set of low bookshelves
supporting a great bronze jar filled with wildflowers  there were
few ornaments about but those few were chiefly of eastern origin and
good of their kind  it looked a room belonging to people of taste
rather than wealth
the divan was so placed in one corner near a window screened by
drawn curtains that it was a full moment before i realized that it
was occupied  a man lay there face downward among the tumbled
cushions in what seemed the apathy of complete exhaustion  he was
clothed only in a suit of thin woolen pyjamas that showed the
meagreness of his frame  he was so thin and slight that he seemed to
fill scarcely any space on the wide couch  he was evidently not
asleep but he had not turned his head at my entrancei could see
only a patch of rumpled dark hair against the pillowsand i crossed
the room and paused beside him
mr lessing
he moved looking at me with petulant questioning eyes from a face
that showed every sign of physical and nervous exhaustion
who are you  i sent for doctor lennox
my name is haverill  i am taking doctor lennoxs place for a few
months
the devil you are  he lifted his head regarding me again intently
with those queer dark eyes the eyes of a boy set in a prematurely
worn face  then lennox has bolted
he has gone to europe for the summer i said looking him full in
the face  he told me he needed a change and i gathered from his
looks he was pretty overworked  so im afraid youll have to put up
with me for a while
thats like old lennox  i thought hed do it some day  he slipped
back again among the cushions  where are you from
i told him  he repeated the name of the hospital after me
mechanically  i didnt know lennox had gone when i sent over
the tone was ungracious but it was more the ungraciousness of a
child than a rational being  i could see that the mans nerves were
fairly on the raw  judging roughly i should say that he had not
slept for several nights  i ignored the hint
as im here i said pleasantly i might as well look you over
dont you think  whats the trouble
for a full minute he did not answer  i fancied he was turning me
over very closely in his mind
the usual thing he said then  overworklike lennoxs  a grim
smile flashed momentarily on me  ive been scratched up  thats
what i want you to see to
an accident
you may call it a dog
he turned with a visible effort  until now he had been lying almost
upon his face  the light came obscured from the window but as i
bent forward i realized with a thrill of what extraordinary physical
endurance that slight body was capable  the right sleeve of his
pyjamas had been torn downit seemed at one single ripand the
edges of the flannel were caked and sodden with blood  as he threw
open the jacket with the other hand i saw two long parallel scratches
of the same depth running transversely across his chest
my first act was to draw the curtain aside  he lay there blinking at
me in the full light watchful to see what change my face betrayed
what you think eh
i think i said quietly that the sooner that dog is shot the
better
i made a movement to draw the jacket down but at the touch of my
hand on his shoulder he winced for the first time
i must have warm water i said  i suppose you are not alone here
almost as i spoke a woman came into the room by a second door
evidently his wife  she was young and her face would have been
noticeably beautiful but for its expressionlessness  she had deep
eyes wellmoulded features and a very clear pallid complexion but
her whole appearance suggested a slatternliness evinced in the
tumbled silk wrapper the carelessly combedback hair  i think i
have never seen a woman least of all in any crisis look so utterly
stupid and bewildered  her eyes were pink about the edges where
powder had been hastily dabbed to hide recent tearmarks  i imagined
that her first impulse in any emergency would be to weep
have you warm water in the house
ill get it
she disappeared toward the kitchen and i followed her in  i wanted
for the moment to be out of range of the man on the couch and i
thought it would give her a chance to say something to me herself of
what had happened
she took up a bowl haphazard from the dresser put it down again and
took another always with the scurrying halffrightened movement with
which she had entered the room went finally through a doorway into
what appeared to be an outer kitchen to fetch the water  there i
heard another womans voice clearcut decisive with what seemed an
undertone of forced cheerfulness to it  scraps of a conversation
reached me while i waited
they wont send it up  ill have to go down later  and scholl will
let us have bread if i fetch it  i thought id better bring three
now
mary its awful
did that new man get here
mrs lessings voice was discreetly dropped drowned by the
accompanying splash of water from a kettle  but i heard the other
say is he any good
mary shh
she fluttered back and i took the bowl of water from her hands
lessing was stretched on the divan just as i had left him waiting my
return  there was no chair near and i looked about me impatiently
for something on which to set the bowl while the woman stood by in a
sort of helpless indecision  just as i was about to put it on the
floor someone pushed mrs lessing gently but promptly aside and came
forward  it was the girl whose voice i had heard in the kitchen and
i saw in the seconds glance i gave her that it was she whom i had
seen on the road the first morning i came down
give me the bowl she said  you can manage better if i hold it
i stripped lessings jacket off as gently as i could sponging the
sleeve where it adhered to the torn flesh  he must have been lying
untended there for some considerable time before my arrival  when i
had laid bare his chest and shoulder to the light i set my lips to an
involuntary whistle  the man looked as if he had been fighting with
some wild animal  no dog had made those wounds  they were not
bites they were long raking cuts as if the flesh had been torn by
heavy bluntpointed claws  a bear might have done it but there was
no sign of bruising or toothprints  the scratch on the shoulder was
a good halfinch deep in one placeit nearly laid bare the bone
he had bled freely the jacket sleeve was soaked and stiff  i set to
work to cleanse the blood from his chest and as i did so i saw other
wounds of the same order some old cicatrices others newly healed
scars of perhaps a month old but none so deep as the present ones
i glanced sharply at the mans hands  they were well kept the
fingers stained a little with acids as though in photography the
nails smooth and closely trimmed
the scratches were ugly  i had slipped an emergency case of tabloids
into my pocket on starting and asking for fresh water i dissolved
two in it  the girl watched me steadily holding the bowl of
solution while i cleansed the cuts carefully bit by bit and i
fancied that in her presence lessing was at particular pains not to
flinch  the mans endurance was extraordinary  i had noticed
something else on his arm but of that i did not immediately speak
you want iodoform said the girl  there is some in the house
she fetched it with diachylon and a roll of sterilized gauze such as
is used in hospitals from the drawer of a japanese cabinet  i
dressed the cutsit took some little timeand helped him into the
clean shirt she brought me  when i straightened my back at last we
were alone
do you mind said lessing going to the cabinet there and getting
me a bottle thats in the top lefthand cupboard  theres a glass
with it
i found both  i drew the glass stopper from the bottle and smelled
it  it contained a familiar cardiac stimulant
its all right  its the stuff lennox gave me
i poured him a dose and he drank it  then he dropped back on the
cushions again watching me  i drew a chair up but on second
thought remained standing
well mr lessing i said i dont know that im able to do
anything more for you under the present circumstances  if you feel
like wanting me you know where to send
what are you in a hurry for
i am in no hurry
then sit down
if you think there is anything to be gained
i sat down  i had dealt with his type before and i waited
well he said
you must know my good fellow that theres no use calling a medical
man in to tell this kind of nonsense  im not a fool
then there he answered you differ most charmingly from old
lennox
i could no more be angry with him than with a sick child
no dog made these scratches
i said you might call it a dog he reminded me
i might call it an ourangoutang and be nearer the mark  am i to
conclude that you keep a menagerie in your house mr lessing
suppose i told you i did it myself
i should call you a liar i said  i have seen your hands
old lennox swore i did  i told you he was a fool
well drop the scratches i said walking to the window  i dont
know that it really matters if you choose to tell me they were done
by a tame mudturtle in the back yard  but one or two things youll
have to stop if im looking after you
such as
you want sleep man  you look as if you hadnt seen bed for a week
i sleep in the daytime  i have to work at night
whatphotography
chemistry  of sorts
chemistry doesnt have to be done at night of necessity i
answered  youre overworked and youre using yourself up  you know
youve hardly a whole nerve left in your body at this moment
ive plenty in my shoulder he returned drily and i smiled
involuntarily as our eyes met  there was a fascination in the man
despite his eccentricity his absurd persistence in what seemed to be
a tissue of childish and reasonless lies to which i held no clue
that wont hurt you long  ill look in again tomorrow  i wheeled
on him abruptly of purpose  how long have you been taking morphia
i expected denial  instead his eyes merely narrowed appreciatively
a year more or less  i take it when i cant sleep
lately
not for several weeks
yes you have i thought  aloud i said ill make you up
something else for a change  can you sleep now
ill have a try
better get to bed
i sleep better here he said and without more ado turned over with
his face to the wall  i waited a moment but he took no further
notice of my presence and i went out
the girl who had helped me with the dressing was outside feeding
sugar to the mare  the two seemed old friends  i saw as i drew
near that she bore a strong resemblance to lessing himself
sufficient to proclaim her his sister  she had the same deep hazel
eyes but her hair was lighter it showed a bronze glint as she stood
bareheaded in the sunshine  it would have been an attractive face
but for a look of cynicism almost a hardness in the lines of her
mouth  i was glad that it was she i encountered instead of mrs
lessing  here was at least one practical person in this puzzling
household
she turned as i came near but without moving
your brother will do all right i said without preamble  keep him
quiet today and if possible make him sleep  he wants rest badly
she nodded brushing the crumbs of sugar from her hands
how long has this been going on
the not sleeping  she looked at me sharply  about four or five
nights
i thought so  cant you make him
she looked at me almost contemptuously as though wondering that my
interview with lessing had taught me so little  does he look as if
i could
you can do it if anyone can i said  i shall be back tomorrow
if by any chance i am wanted
ill come and fetch you she said
good  i turned to unfasten the mare then paused  you have a dog
here i think  may i see it
for a moment she seemed about to hesitate  if you like she said
then
i followed her round to the side of the house  a small sort of
toolshed stood not far from the odd building i had noticed and
which i saw now was not an annex but separate from the house  the
door of the shed was closed and from within a whining and scratching
greeted our approach  without a word she turned the key and threw
open the door
i heerd you was called over thar yesterday  reckon youll have
enough to do if you take on with all the crazy folks round here
i looked at him hard
oh i aint got nothing special against mr lessing  hes a
pleasantspoken chap all ive seen of him  ony when a man gits to
meddlin with things it aint no persons business to meddle with
hes liable to git called crazyef not worse  i aint holdin with
what people say when they get to talkinno sir  i got enough to do
tendin my own business  but theres plenty wont go near mr
lessings place after dark nor no other time an if you was to
listen to them i reckon they got their reasons  they say his wifes
as crazy as he is  seems when he aint traipsin round the woods all
hours o the night hes shut up there in that stoodio place doin his
vivisectin
what
i laughed in spite of myself  mr johnson looked sulky
aint that what they call it  i aint no doctor
mr lessing happens to be a student of chemistry not a medical
student so if anyones been trying to get round you with bogy tales
theyre talking nonsense  im surprised at a man of your education
mr johnson listening to such absurdities
then what does he shut himself up for with a lamp you can see two
miles off unless hes up to suthin he dont want folks to know
probably because he doesnt want a pack of ignoramuses meddling with
his affairs
well thats what they say and theres folks as believes it he
said sullenly  an as fur his walkin in the woods i aint tellin
you anything but whats so  he was seen the same night as jake
menning got killed goin down dutchmans hill  it was jakeys
halfbrother as seen him an aaron aint one to be tellin lies
no sir  an if doctor lennox was here now he would tell you the
same for he was called out to see a sick child at the bend that same
night and it was him as found jake menning there the next mornin
do you know youre saying things you might get into trouble over i
asked sternly
oh i aint sayin he had no hand in it he returned promptly
everyone knows jakey got killed through bein too drunk to look whar
he was goin
i pushed a quarter over to him
well give me some stamps mr johnson  if you take my advice you
wont pay quite so much attention to idle gossip
i drove home thinking  lennox or someone had been chattering
that was clear  how far i had no means at present of knowing for i
was not going to pursue any further conversation with johnson ready
as he was  a doctor who gives himself to gossip is no better than an
old hen  i felt a sharp contempt for lennox that overrode whatever
interest i might once have had for him  if he had got himself into
any tangle down here he deserved it thoroughly
a light covered wagon such as hucksters use was outside the gate
when i got back and a man who had evidently been bargaining with
mrs searle at the back door came round and climbed into it  i had
to pull the mare up to one side to give him room to drive off and as
i waited i happened to notice him rather closely the more so as he
gave me a civil but obvious scrutiny himself as he climbed over the
wagonwheel  he was a man of about forty in a tightly buttoned coat
of greasy black oilskin and a peaked cap which might have belonged
earlier in its career to a seafaring man pulled down over his
forehead  his face with unpleasantly closeset eyes was scarred by
smallpox and apart from the repugnance which this disfigurement
always inspires more or less i think i have seldom seen a
countenance which impressed me more disagreeably  he was a man whom
i would have ordered off my own premises anywhere at first sight and
i replied with a curt nod to his oversubservient greeting
i left the mare in the yard and went into the parlor  mrs searle
had evidently been interrupted in her morning tidying and she came
back duster in hand as i stood there  i had enough experience to
know her for a woman who did not give herself to gossip though she
probably knew all that was afoot by the curious intuitive sense so
highly developed in all women of her class  with her i would be
perfectly safe in any inquiries i chose to make
she apologized for her intrusion and set about completing her tour of
the furniture with noiseless briskness
i see youve been down to the village sir she said after a
moment  i was going to ask whether youd order some more coal up
for tomorrow from harknesss  its most finished
ill send pete this afternoon  he can walk in  by the way mrs
searle what was this story about jake menning  i just heard
something of it in the village today
jake menning  she paused in her dusting setting back a vase
carefully on the mantelshelf  i suppose youd have heard of it
sir  he was killed last march goin down dutchmans hill  there
isnt much water now but its generally deep there long after the
spring rains  some did say it was done apurpose but the most of
em thinks he jest had a fit an fell in  doctor lennox found him
about six oclock in the mornin driving back from a night call  he
was lyin jest at the foot of the hollow where them planks begin
with his face in the water  it wasnt deep enough to drown anyone
ordinarily an thats why they thought it was a seizure
there was two halfbrothers jake an aaron both livin over near
the bend  aarons took the whole business over now  jake was always
kind o queer they called him crazy sometimes round the village
they was as like as two peas which was queer seein they was ony
half related so to speak  down to the smallpox scars an all
theyd both took the smallpox but jake took it worse and they said
that was what affected his brain some  you couldnt tell em apart
ony for aarons stutterin
aaron was the best of the two  hes a good chapel member and hes
done a lot better in the business since jakeys out of it  i heard
they used to quarrel a lot in jakes lifetime  aarons savin and a
bit close with his money too and i recon he kep jake under some
he was an awful illlookin man jake menningnot that i like to say
wrong of the dead but i know a badlookin man when i see one an
jake was that for all his craziness  there werent anyone liked him
much so they said he was harmless as a child and right smart in
business an now they aint content with his being dead but they
must get to startin nonsense about his walkingexcuse me
mentionin any such silly talk to you sir
walking i stared
what they call it sir she explained apologetically  you see
she went on taking up her duster again dutchmans hill always did
have a bad name account of a pedlar bein drowned there years ago
and now with this other business they try to make out the place is
haunted again  they dont seem to know rightly whether its crazy
jake or the pedlar i told you of but theres quite a lot of folks
now wont go nigh the place after dark no moren if it had the
plague
so thats what all this nonsense has been about i said a light
beginning to dawn on me  i suppose pete is right in it all
pete is like all the niggers sir  they aint happy unless theyve
got some sort of a hant to tell about  not that the other folks
here is any better an i will say that of em  i never met such a
gossipin set in my life till i come here
mrs searle herself was originally from new england and eight years
residence here had not altered her original opinion of the people
for this reason if for none other i knew that she kept herself very
sternly aloof from the minor scandalmaking of the place
i suppose there was an inquest on this man
oh yes sir  they brought it in accidental causes an doctor
lennox seemed to think the man died of heartfailure an he must
have been dead before he fell in  anyway it wasnt drownin simple
i dont know  it was aaron had heartweakness in the family as i
heard so it was queer jake bein the one took off that way
i rose
well i suppose the people here have precious little to gossip
about and they like to make a mystery of whatever does happen
thats about as i take it sir  she moved toward the door  an
now i think it was funny your asking me about jake menning just
this moment  that was aaron as came round to the back door a while
ago as you drove up  he wanted to know if wed like any chickens
so i took one for sunday seen he only gets round once a fortnight
now he has the whole business to attend to  i dont know whether
its thinkin over it but it seems to me hes getting to look more
like jakey every day  if it wernt for his stutterin i could take
him for a ghost myself
so that was aaron menning  well he might be a good chapel member
but he had a face that would hang him if my impressions went for
anything  all the same this put me no nearer to clearing up the
mystery at the bend which was what interested me at the moment
jake menning and the alleged ghost of dutchmans hill were ordinary
enough features in a village drama but they could have no direct
bearing on the problem that occupied my mind
after lunch i told peter to put the mare in  he lingered about the
buggy when i came out making unnecessary adjustments to the harness
i could see he was anxious to learn the outcome of yesterdays visit
and where i was going now
is yoh gwine by de village doctah he asked finally with the air
of one with a commission to request
no im going to the bend  there is no need for you to drive me i
added as i took the reins up
i could have sworn the old sinner looked relieved as he went back to
the coachhouse  when i reached the bungalow i found lessing himself
on the porch  as he rose to greet me i saw that he was taller than i
had thought there was a certain wiry strength about him when he
stood upright  what amazed me was the mans extraordinary endurance
and resiliency his face showed scarcely a sign of the exhaustion of
yesterday  he was dressed in corduroy trousers and a soft silk
shirt under which the outline of the bandaging was visible as he
moved
well how are you i asked as we shook hands
all right  come into the houseor shall we stay here
ill have a look at you first  i followed him into the room  a
bit stiff
nothing much
sleep
like a log
i need hardly have asked him  he stripped up his shirt and i made a
brief readjustment of the dressings  the wounds were going on all
right  he must have had a magnificent constitution despite his
slightness of build  we sat down on the divan and lessing produced
a box of cigarettes
there was a small wooden table near the window littered with
testtubes and odds and ends and i nodded toward it
been busy
i was just working out something  i have a sort of laboratory
fitted outside though  i had it built
that sort of studio place
its just like a workshopwhere i muddle occasionally  ill show
you sometime if you like
i should be delighted
my experiments have unfortunately given rather a bad name to the
place  they had a bad effect on old lennox too  i believe i was
too progressive for him  you wouldnt expect that from a medical
man would you  did you know lennox very well
he knocked the ash off his cigarette waiting for my reply  if he
was guarded so was i
i knew him at the university a good while ago  since then i had
not seen him till the other day
hes a queer old bird  i used to tell him he made the ideal country
practitioner  it made him mad because it was so exactly true  we
used to disagree frightfully you know  its the only relaxation in
a place like this  i shall miss lennox
it struck me he was trying in a casual way to find out how far
lennox had spoken of him to me and whether we had been at any time
since his departure in correspondence
lennox has quaint theories he went on leaning back against the
cushions  one of them is that nothing exists outside the
pharmacopia and burtons north american fauna  we used to
argue it at great length  i dont believe hes convinced yet
he was never an easy man to convince
so  its habit that survives  how do you like it down here by the
way
oh im putting in a good time i smiled  i fish a little tramp
a little  there ought to be good shooting in these woods by and by
they are interesting said lessing drily
have you been here long i asked
over a year  he rose and went into the kitchen whence he returned
a moment later saying i thought i heard my wife there  we might
as well have some tea
it was miss lessing who brought the tea in a few minutes later  she
greeted me pleasantly setting the tray down on the little table i
pulled forward for her
kate is lying down for a while she said to her brother  she has
a headache  do you take sugar doctor haverill
i sat chatting there for nearly an hour  lessing seemed at all
events disposed to be friendly  all the while i was trying to
reconcile this man who sat talking boyishly on trivial subjects with
the outstretched figure i had seen twentyfour hours ago  if i had
felt any resentment for his treatment of me yesterday it would have
vanished utterly and his complete absence of restraint now showed
me if i had needed it how all memory of that mood had changed with
his physical condition
when i rose to go it was under promise to dine with them the
following week  i fancied that miss lessing glanced hesitatingly at
her brother before she seconded his invitation  it might have been
only fancy she was certainly cordial enough as we shook hands
next thursday then lessing called after me from the doorway  i
drove home no less mystified than before
v
the dead cyclist
lennox sent me a note from queenstown  i wondered reading the brief
cheerful account of his crossing if he guessed how much i would give
to have him cornered for a halfhours interview  that he could
throw considerable light on the puzzle i did not doubt any more than
that he had promptly put the ocean between us with a view to avoiding
the very question i wanted to put to him  anyway he was securely out
of reach and there was no use in wasting speculation
my motorcycle had arrived some time ago but up to now i had not
made use of it  it was housed in the carriageshed to peters great
curiosity  once i had caught him meddling with it surreptitiously
and my lecture garnished with many lies as to what would happen to
him if he pursued investigations wrought the desired effect on his
superstitious mind  devils offered to peter the most natural
explanation for anything he failed to understand  having a free
morning it occurred to me to put the engine in order and peter
cleaning harness nearby watched my proceedings with distrustful
curiosity
is yoh gwine ride dat ar thing doctah he asked me
sure  i stood up wiping my grimed hands on a piece of cotton
waste  dont you think its a likely thing to scare the hants
with pete
yoh talk er de hants doctah cause yoh ain done seen em
when yohs done seen em doctah i raikon yose gwine talk er suthin
eke
if i meet one on this pete itll give him such fits he wont do
any hanting for a week  give me that monkeywrench
he eyed me gloomily
dat ar things got a debbil in um sure an yoh ain git no better
er one debbil by mixin um up wid anufferno sah
peter i said you are too conservative
i dknow dat  i dknow dat  de debbils de dibbil an dar ain no
good yet come er mixin up wid him  tain in de bible nor tain in
nature an i ain holdin wid no such dealins
well pete im going to back my devil against your rabbits foot
anyhow
pete looked suspicious
whos been talkin bout rabbits foots doctah
no one  turn your pockets out pete
his hand clapped involuntarily to the side of his trousers
i got ter put dat harness away an i ain got the time t be
hindered in  sholy to gawd doctah yoh ain spose i carry no
trash like that
he straightened himself with dignity hanging the harness up on its
pegs  i finished my job and went into the surgery  i had written to
the city for the drug i wanted for lessing  it arrived yesterday
and i had made up the powders  they were lying on the desk with a
rubber band about them and the packet caught my eye as i came in  i
called to pete
i want you to take a prescription over to mr lessing i said
you can take the buckboard and bring back that sack of feed from
sliefers at the same time
i held the packet out to him  he eyed first it then me
well i said impatiently
ise gwine ise gwine  i was thinkin ony dis mawnin how dat
feed done oughter be fetched  yessir i was sayin dat out in de
cargehouse  it done oughter be fetched today
itll be right on your road after you leave mr lessings
yessir dat so  ony dat packet doctah  i was jest considerin
dat packet  ef i was to put dat packet in de buckboard longer de
feed sack id be right scared er losing it  it dont seem to me
doctah dat ar packet gwine t be very safe dat way
but youve got a pocket you old idiot
yessir i done got pockets  i was ony jest astudyin doctah  i
don recommend pockets not when a pussons got a commission to tend
to  when a pusson puts suthin in his pocket it happens sometime
dat a pussons gwine forget it
if it happens to you i assured him ill find a way of operating
on your memory so youd better be careful
he took the packet without more ado and went off to get the buckboard
ready  it was too fine a day to waste about the house and i had it
in mind to take the cycle out for a spin  telling mrs searle i
would probably be away for lunch i got into my cycling suit and set
off
i followed the road for some distance past the bend and then
branched off to the right joining the pike  the machine was in good
running order and i did some twenty miles before i slowed up finally
at a little village with the hope of getting something to eat
there was the usual hotel and saloon combined with its array of
spruce bushes in tubs before the entrance  i leaned my cycle against
the porch and went in to interview the landlord about a meal
dinner was by luck just ready  i cleaned off some of the grime of my
ride and wandered into the commercial room which was garnished with
horsehair furniture a mildewed engraving of washington and two
plates of sticky flypaper buzzing and noxious set out on the
soiled tablecloth  there was one other midday guest a young man in
a gray suit who sat watching the struggles of the latest addition to
the flypaper colony while he waited for dinner  i placed him
immediately as a newspaper man and the first dozen words we
exchanged as i took my place opposite to him at the table proved me
right  he had been sent down on the trial of one of those dull and
elusive scandals which serve to lighten the papers during the dead
season and had to put in two hours waiting for his train back to
the city
he had a considerable fund of anecdote which needed only the barest
encouragement to set going and he transferred his interest from the
flypaper to myself with complimentary promptitude  he had a trick
of raising his voice a full three tones at the beginning of each
sentence and as his dissertations were lengthy i found myself
speculating at to what new and rasping height his voice might next
reach
there was a weekold copy of a local paper lying on the table and in
a pause of the meal he pushed it over to me
theres a thing that might interest you being a cyclist he said
what do you make of that kind of an accident
i read the paragraph he pointed out  it was the account of an
inquest held on the body of a young man identified as one george
powell salesman in a philadelphia drygoods store  he had been
found on a stretch of road a few miles beyond coopersville by a
farmer taking an early load of milk to the coopersville creamery
the handlebars and front part of his wheel near by were damaged
and the broken lamp was picked up a few yards further on  the man
was dead but the curious part which had evidently struck my
acquaintance also was that there were no injuries found on the body
except a single diagonal scratch across the face which was of
sufficient depth to have destroyed one eye and to lay the entire
cheek open  this in itself had not produced death and the coroners
autopsy had revealed no symptom of concussion  the medical officers
verdict had been death from heart failure
the injuries suggested attack but there had been no robbery and
though the mans clothing was torn his pockets were apparently
untouched  they contained thirtyfive dollars in notes in a
pocketbook some small change and the papers that had led to his
identification
well said my acquaintance
it looks queer
he laid a finger on the paragraph
you see the body was picked up fifteen yards from the edge of the
wood  if anyone had laid for him theyd have laid right in the
woods where there was cover  but whatever hit him it hit him
before he reached there
he might have run into something
as what
i dont know  and there struck me instantly the thought that my
companion put into words  if you run into anything on a bicycle at
full speed it doesnt generally happen that the handlebars get the
worst injury  you see that the front wheel was not much broken  and
he was riding toward the woods and its going to take a pretty
phenomenal shock to throw a man and his bicycle fifteen yards
backwards  ill tell you another thing  i happen to know that
stretch of road because i spent part of last summer near there with
some people  its a level stretch cleared both sides and there
isnt anything larger than a stone to run into
i waited wondering what he was driving at  he chose a toothpick
from the holder and began to employ it leisurely
youd reckon those things would strike the jury wouldnt you  but
theyre so dam simple down here that theyre content to come up
against facts like that and they say well heres a man got killed
and we dont know what hit him  guess well let it go at
misadventure and go get a drink  thats their mental attitude and
there isnt anything going to shake them out of it
whats your theory i asked
he revolved the toothpick meditatively
if i knew i guess id be up against a story that would make every
newspaper in the country sit up  theres something queer there and
ill tell you why and youll see just how enterprising these country
juries are  last aprilhe raised his voice again giving the
toothpick an extra twirl in emphasisprecisely the same thing
happened to another man not twelve miles from where this was  he
was killed under much about the same circumstances and the jury then
returned the same old verdict with a caution about the dangers of
scorching  i happen to know because i was down there on some story
the time the thing occurred  i saw the man  he paused and without
knowing why i felt my pulses quicken suddenly in anticipation  he
had marks on his body that a wildcat couldnt have made  he was
picked up at the side of the path among some stiff underbrush so
of course they said the fall did it  i tell you he was ripped like
ive seen a dogs face ripped by a badger  ive seen murder cases
and ive seen accidents but ive never seen the precise accident
that would leave that kind of marks
you think it was murder
the man wasnt murdered  he hit his head against a stone and died
of concussion that time right enough  but it was near enough to
murder if you assume an assailant whod strap twoinch steel claws
on to his hands  he laughed  its an original outfit  but thats
what im asking you  whats the animal that goes round in these
woods thats strong enough to wreck the steel tubing of a bicycle
that attacks with its claws and not with its teeth and thats quick
enough to knock a man down without the chance of a struggle
there were no traces
none  not a single footprint
all the while he spoke there had been before my mind the picture of
lessinglessing with those inexplicable scratches on his chest
whatever had attacked these two had attacked lessing also that i
would swear to  i was conscious that the young man was watching me
rather closely
heard something of this before have you
no  it interests me  but i think youre on a wrong tack
how
man alive you dont suppose there could conceivably be any animal
of that kind loose in the country without people knowing it  someone
would have seen it
i guess two people did see it he suggested
if anything escaped from a menagerie thered be a hue and cry
raised  the woods around here couldnt give cover to any animal of
that size and ferocity for three months without some track of it
being found
he said how about the murders in the rue morgue
those scratches werent made by a monkey
i was unguarded  he looked up sharply
you didnt see them
you have described them i reminded him  besides an apes
instinct is to strangle
not necessarily
put the first down as a murder  the second might not have had any
connection  there is nearly three months between  the medical
officer suggested himself that the injuries might have been caused by
falling on the broken bicycle framework
medical officers arent infallible  theyve got to say something
i laughed  well stick to your escaped simian theory  if a third
case turns up well see whos right
i rose paid my bill and went out leaving him i have no doubt with
the impression that i was a particularly hidebound idiot  but i had
my own reasons for making no further contribution to his data  i
would see this thing through without any assistance from a too
enterprising press
vi
a boycotted household
thursday evening found me at the lessings bungalow  mrs lessing
was in evidence this time in a soft black gown that accentuated the
pallor of her face  the evening did not correct my first impressions
of her  she shook hands limply contributed a few remarks about the
weather and then subsided on the couch in silence  dinner was laid
on a small round table near the window and mary lessing came in from
the kitchen with uprolled sleeves and a big apron tied about her
we do our own chores here doctor haverill she said  do you want
to make yourself useful
i rose promptly  lessing had not yet appeared and my teteatete
with his wife was not exhilarating  i followed her out into the
kitchen where she gave me a canopener and a box of sardines
turn those out for me please  and if you have any hygienic
aversion to canned goods smother it  we live on them here
you find it far from the village
she smiled quizzically  a good way  besides the tradespeople
here arent exactly genial  so we subsist on boxes from the city
it gives you all the real pleasure of a desert island without the
risks  put them on that plate will you  you see by the time the
box arrives and gets hauled up from the station weve generally
forgotten what we ordered so theres all the excitement of discovery
as well  this time it was olives  do you realize the joy of
unexpected olives in the wilderness
im going to
thats the right spirit  living in the country teaches one a
becoming humility  there are more things to open  perhaps it was a
mistake to ask you out here but in any case i could hardly have
palmed off these peaches as grown in our own garden because we
havent got one
she was standing at the table drying crisp salad on a white cloth
the position showed me only her profile with a little wave of bronze
hair escaping near one ear  do you think gardening is worth the
trouble
when things like this grow in every department store  perhaps not
good heavens doctor haverhill but you must wash that canopener
give it to me
i gazed at the jagged gash already achieved in the peachcan
dont tell anyone and they wont taste it
i thought bachelors knew how to do everything
sardines and peaches go excellently together i maintained  they
call it salade de fruits poissonnes
lessing lounged in
i admire the way mary sets you to work he said  she has a talent
for being industrious by proxy  here  he pulled a parcel out of
his pocket ive brought your cheese but i wont answer for the
state of it
miss lessing cast a quick glance at me  where
not at johnsons  i dont know if my sister has explained to you
doctor haverhill that we are a boycotted household  we find it
quite amusing  it leads to a practice of expedience which is
excellent training for the young  mary has learned to make quite
creditable bread already
out of the sawdust they pack the canned goods in put in his sister
promptly  carry that dish in without spilling it dick and dont
talk nonsense
we sat down to one of the most cheerful meals four young people have
ever enjoyed  i would except mrs lessing but that even her limp
and monosyllabic presence failed to dampen our spirits  afterwards
lessing made turkish coffee over a spirit lamp while the two girls
cleared the table refusing my assistance highhandedly
i moved about the room in the familiarity which our informal meal had
fostered looking at the knickknacks the row of books on the
shelves  they were a pretty varied collection poetry some modern
french scientific books and novels and one of the most complete
collections of detective literature i have ever encountered side by
side with a few textbooks on chemistry and some volumes on occultism
and black magic some familiar to me by title others unknown  there
was a monthly magazine lying near which i recognized as occupying
itself largely with the subject of psychic phenomena and turning it
over i noticed lessings name in the index
you write i asked
once in a blue moon  he looked up from a critical stage in his
coffeemaking  does that sort of thing interest you
indifferentlyif it happens to be genuine
theres so little genuine  he withdrew the coffee deftly blowing
out the lamp and stood the little copper pot aside  thats the
worst of it  one endures hours of boredom for no result
you belong to the prs
a most respectable and unexciting body  he smiled  i would give
in my demission only they afford me a patient hearing from time to
time  besides it gives me the opportunity of wrangling with
someone and contention is the spice of life as i was saying  it
was with that truism that i strove to console lennox when i bored
him to extinction
involuntarily my ears pricked
was that often
no i cant say the boredom predominated in the long run  he
surveyed his coffee with the air of an artist his boyish head on one
side
where are those cups mary
your system of boredom seemed to have a remarkable effect on lennox
anyway slipped from me involuntarily
lessing laughed  oh that was when the boredom ended  he stood it
nobly to a point  he turned toward me  would you like to see what
frightened lennox sometime
before i could answer mary lessing came in with the coffeecups and
the subject was dropped
it was ten oclock when i rose to leave my departure hastened by a
suspicion that mrs lessing had glanced several times of purpose at
the clock  they all came out on the porch to say good night and at
the last moment lessing added ill walk down the hill with you
ive got my bicycle i said quickly as miss lessing looked up
theres no need to bring you out
oh itll do me good
it was a still sultry night with a humidity in the air that had
arisen since nightfall  we walked leisurely smoking as far as the
crossroad at the top of dutchmans hill  the hollow below was alive
with fireflies gleaming and vanishing alternately in the soft dusk
there should be a moon but within the past hour premonitory
rainclouds had gathered blotting it out  lessing glanced at the sky
how long will it take you to get back
ten minutes more or less  it wont rain till i get there
i scratched a match stooping toward my bicycle lantern
is it necessary to light that he asked
why not  theres a bad bit of road at the bottom there
i find the glare of a lamp like that always makes it worse  what is
it acetylene
he bent over the lantern to examine it and in the pause the match
burned down and went out  i felt for the box again in my pocket and
as i did so lessing let go his hold on the bicycle  the machine
slipped by its weight and reaching quickly to catch it i heard the
unmistakable sound of escaping air
now youve done it cried lessing boyishly
damn  i groped for the rear tire  it was flat  heres a
cheerful business  how the dickens
lessing laughed  well have to walk it now  never mind  i know
the road
im not going to bring you all that way i said  i shall be all
right
nonsense  i like a walk before i turn in
he took hold of the bicycle on one side i on the other and together
we set off to walk down the hill  there is an exhilaration in
walking through woods at night even tempered by the necessity of
pushing a heavy motorcycle before you and my brief annoyance at the
accident rapidly vanished  lessing was boyishly highspirited
between us we made a fairly rowdy trip of it  we had just finished
the ascent of the other side of the hollow when he laid a sudden hand
on my arm
did you hear anything
no  why
i thought he was still joking but his cloak of nonsense had dropped
from him abruptly  he pulled me to the side of the road
listen
there seemed nothing to listen for  i waited rather impatiently
lessing threw back his head scanning the line of the trees that shut
us in  there
it was still in my mind that he was trying to play some game on me
its nothing but a bird i said
bird  you heard nothing else
no
come on lessing said  he seemed abruptly sobered and i fancied
he was at pains to quicken our pace over the remaining stretch of
road  when we sighted the glimmer of the orchard palings i pulled up
come on into the house and have a drink i said
no thanks  i must get back  by the way do you carry a revolver
what on earth for
i only wondered  i should advise you to around here  his hand
slipped down to his pocket and i heard a soft click
what are you going to do
have a pot at the birds going back  he smiled  good night
look in sometime during the week
and he went off without further delay whistling softly
vii
what happened in the laboratory
instead it was lessing who came a day or two later to see me  he
lounged in one evening when i was sitting smoking on the porch after
supper and my first advice of his presence was the clatter of a zinc
pail which pete let fall promptly in the side yard  when lessing
rounded the corner of the porch he was grinning
your nigger must have a bad conscience he said  i never saw
anyone so afraid of the devil in all my life
i made a sound of annoyance  evidently i had not finished with pete
yet  hes a born idiot i said
im not so sure lessing returned  he has a very practical regard
for his own skin  i appreciate that
you ought to
he gave me one of those habitual quick looks his head on one side
thanks  do you find the mosquitoes bad around here  i got all
bitten up coming past dutchmans hollow
i took the hint
well sit indoors i said  its pretty cool in the surgery
he followed me into the room glancing curiously about him
so this is where old lennox hung out  the place has a look of
him  whats that butterflies  he always had a weakness for things
he could stick a pin into and label nicely
have you never been here before
never  he used to come to my place  i have an idea you know that
lennox still thinks im not right in the head
i lit the student lamp on the table and set out whisky and a couple
of glasses  lessing settled himself in the shabby armchair opposite
me and for a little while we smoked in silence  in the halfshadow
beyond the ring of lamplight i could see his face fine and clear cut
against the shabby morocco of the chair back the dark hair tumbled
over his forehead  he was staring up at the smoke wreaths in a
curious intensity of abstraction
i suppose he began at last that i owe you some sort of an
explanation as things go
i made a little gesture of indifference  i was beginning to know my
man  if it pleased him to work upon my curiosity i was prepared to
give him the least possible satisfaction
you offered me one i corrected him  i believe we decided to let
it go at that
he turned his gaze upon me with a rather charming impertinence
that was when i took you for a fool  as i admit the error you ought
to forgive my expression of it  the truth is  he paused so long
that i reached for a fresh cigarette to break the interval  ill be
damned if i know what the truth is myself  he finished almost
violently  i can give you factsall you want  when it comes to
putting things together  do you know how maddening it is to have
your hand on a thingactually on itand feel it all the while
slipping through your fingers
he threw his cigarette away  lets drop all this nonsense anyway
i came over here tonight to have a talk with you  i tell you
frankly because youre about the only sane man im likely to cross
down here  i tried lennox once and lennox thought i was batty and
there the matter ended  but ive got to a point now where its
absolutely necessary for the sake of my own mental balance that i
should have someone elses opinion about things  im going to put
certain facts before you and youll say what you think about them
i nodded
about eighteen months ago lessing began my wife was in rather
bad health  it was some sort of nervous trouble which i need not
enter into here but the doctor said she needed complete change and
that she must positively live in the country for some time a year or
two at least  we came down here  i bought the piece of ground up
the hill there and built the little bungalow we are living in with
the idea of using it later on when her health is restored simply as
a summer cottage  i have a fondness for dabbling in chemistry as i
think i told you and shortly after we moved down here i built that
sort of outdoor study you have seen so that i could have a place
perfectly quiet that i could work in without being disturbed and
without messing the house up with my things  i am not a good
sleeper  i sit up pretty late at night as a rule and it worries me
to know im disturbing other people in the house or that the women
are liable to drop in in their dressinggowns at halfpast one or so
to ask whether im going to bed or not
my laboratory has a top light for day use and i have rigged up an
acetylene lamp just over my table with a pretty strong light  one
night last fall i happened to be working rather late  as a rule i
have no difficulty whatever about keeping awakeits the other way
about in factbut along about one oclock i began to get rather
drowsy  it might have been the fumes of the chemicals i was using
but im used to that and anyway i dont think they could have
affected me  my interest in what i was doing was still awake but
the other side of my mind seemed to get drowsy at the same time  i
fought against it a long while and then gradually i seemed to get
the consciousness of somethingsome presencein or near the room
i dont know if you have ever attended a seance haverill
neverof any account
my cigarette had burned down to my fingers and i threw it away  i
was beginning to get keenly interested in his story
well if you had you would know that one sometimes gets the sense
of a materialization some minutes before it actually takes place  i
suppose the subconscious part of ones mind acts more quickly than
the senses in receiving an impression  anyway that was what seemed
to happen with me  i waited  i was awake i want you to understand
that clearly  i was as awake as i am now  i saw everything about
me but i seemed to see it in a quite impersonal sort of way
the top light is arranged to open in sections the top as well as
the four sides  the side glasses were my idea for bad weather so
that i could always have ventilation on one side or the other without
rain driving in as it will with an ordinary skylight  i had the
middle section raised and one side open as well  presently i was
conscious that something was trying to enter at the glass  there
were no sound on the roof itself which is galvanized but i could
hear plainly a sort of scraping at the window  the inside light was
so strong that i could see nothing but something was gradually
obscuring the opening  i had a conviction that the thing whatever
it was was attracted by my light and i made an effort with the
strange drowsiness gaining on me to reach the lamp and turn it out
i was on my feet reaching across the table with the glare of the
lamp full in my eyes when somethingi dont know whatstruck me
and threw me to the ground  my hand was already on the lamp and i
must have managed to turn it out actually in the moment of falling
i have a recollection of struggling for a moment there in the
darkness of trying with some sort of hazy instinct to drag myself
under cover of the table and then i suppose i became unconscious
when i came to it was broad daylight  i was lying on the floor
near the table  there was broken glass near me and i seemed to
remember the crash of it before i lost consciousness  my clothes
were torn my arms and chest were badly scratchedi must have
somehow defended my face without knowing itand i was stiff all over
when i moved  when i got into the open i was seized with an intense
nausea which lasted for several minutes  my wife and sister are
used to my being up till all hours so that my absence had caused no
uneasiness  i went into the house washed myself as well as i could
and went to sleep  it was then five oclock so that i must have
been nearly four hours unconscious
did you notice any other symptoms besides the nausea i interrupted
yes an intense fatigue  it was not sleepiness  i was tired out
as if i had been through some great exertion
well i said for i knew he had not finished
that was last october the twentyfourth to be exact  since then
the thing has happened twice again  on each occasion i have had the
same premonitory drowsiness  i have struggled against it and it has
mastered me at just the critical moment  the second time when i came
to i was more badly hurt than before  my sister happened to be up
early that morning and there was no disguising my condition from
her  she went off for lennox  when he came he fixed me up and gave
me a sleeping draughtwhich i didnt needand i slept nearly the
whole day  he held the opinion which i wrested from him later that
i had had some sort of seizure the result of overwork and that i
had inflicted the injuries on myself during unconsciousness  the
rest he put down to hallucination  he was a fool and i told him so
whatever the thing was it was no hallucination
how wide was the skylight open
about eighteen inches
did you find any traces in the morning
not a mark  the building is high as you know and the sides are of
perfectly plain boarding  there is nothing that could give foothold
except to a monkey and the nearest tree is eight feet off  oh i
went over the whole ground carefully  whatever it was that came it
did not reach me from the ground
i moved impatiently  but what other way could it have reached you
thats what i ask myself said lessing grimly  do i look like a
man subject to brain trouble
no i said  i gave that theory up almost immediately
then what do you make of it he asked quietly
make of it i cried  good heavens man do you realize that
youre asking me to believe a thing thats outside the range of all
human possibility
human possibility  what is human possibility  i tell you the thing
as it happened simply  he rose and began to pace to and fro in the
room  im a sane man  im not given to imaginary things  and
besidesyou saw yourself
wait a moment i said  about this light  have you used the same
lamp right along
lessing gave a quick look  i wondered if he had divined my visit to
the laboratory that first morning
no  i altered it after the second time  there was an interval of
over four months when nothing happened at all  i tried to reason it
all out and i concluded that in some way the lamp had had to do with
it  from the position of the building and the woods about it the
light i was at first using could be visible only from one certain
direction  i wanted to investigate the whole thing systematically
and with that idea i raised the lamp and fitted a strong reflector
that would throw the light outside the building at will and in any
direction
his description corresponded with the light i had seen above the
treetops the night of petes adventure with the turkeybuzzard
you were using this the last time
yes  i had been experimenting with it off and on for several
weeks
have you any idea of the shape of the thing i asked him
so far as i could make out anything outside the glass i might
describe it as some kind of dog  it seemed to be greyish  but
that as a theory is sheer nonsense  you know that no dog could have
made the scratches you saw
one thing still puzzled me
you say that you put the light out yourself the first time
yes
and the second
there was scarcely time to get any definite impression he answered
evasively  i was struck down almost at once
but you had the impression of a dog
what does it matter he cried with a sudden change of voice  i
tell you haverill it was like nothing that i can describe
we sat there for some minutes in silence  i can see now the turn of
lessings head the restless movement of his fingers on the
chairarm  it seemed incongruous that we should be sitting here in
this commonplace room amid surroundings which spoke so emphatically
of the practical routine of life discussing that which should have
branded us both as madmen
it was lessing who broke the silence first
what the good he said with a short laugh  ive told you the
whole business and its up to you to make what you choose of it
the only conclusion seems to be that we are up against something
which is as you put it outside the range of experience  good  but
suppose i told you that it wasnt outside the range of
experiencethat what i saw has been seen by other people upon
independent testimony ten twenty thirty years ago
i thought of the reporters story  but there would be time to
contribute my data presently after lessing had told me all that he
knew
did you ever hear of an apparition called the jersey devil he
asked
i dont remember it
you probably wouldnt lessing replied  he took a fresh cigarette
from the box and lit it  the tale afforded some stray paragraphs in
the papers at different times much as the periodical accounts of
authentic ghosts do but i dont believe anyone gave the slightest
credence to it  the jersey devil to sum up all that i have been
able to glean on the subject was a legendary monster reputed to
have been seen on the evidence of several persons at different
periods during the past fifty or sixty years  the legend goes back
i believe to just before the civil war  according to the story its
appearance gives warning to some national trouble or calamity  it
was said to have been seen before lincolns assassination before the
spanishamerican war and before the assassination of president
mckinley  it is described as a creature having the body of a bat and
the head of a horsesometimes as a quasihuman head on a winged
animal bodyand it haunts certain counties of new jersey chiefly
monmouth and ocean counties and has also been seen as far north as
pennsylvania  the legend goes that it is a changeling that is to
say a devil which took possession of a childs body at birth and
flew off in the shape of a monster  why it should have developed the
sort of national solicitude they claim for it is unexplained  of
course the evidence is almost entirely that of superstitious country
people who saw it or thought they saw it but the fact remains that
the evidence in every case tallies even after intervals of ten or
twenty years
we may take it that very legend has somewhere some natural origin
however much it may be subsequently exaggerated or distorted  why
if this particular legend is purely imaginary should it be confined
to certain districts and not to others  we are not dealing with an
apparition reputed to haunt one particular place  it has a pretty
wide range of country on the contrary and its appearance has been
vouched for almost simultaneously in places a great many miles
apart  why should it be seen in one certain county and not in the
adjoining ones where the inhabitants are probably equally
superstitious  also it is not seen actually at the time of trouble
when peoples minds might be most naturally influenced by
superstition but days and sometimes weeks before the event  that
fact in itself i attach no importance to  there is a coincidence
and people naturally connect the two ideas  but i mention it to
prove that in no instance was the thing seen because it was expected
to be seen its appearance in each case was entirely without warning
or predisposition
i moved in my chair
weve got enough to deal with as the thing stands  if youre going
to back it up with any old wives tales of a batwinged horse
im not backing it up lessing retorted  im only asking myself
whether the experiences that give rise to the tale of the jersey
devil have any connection with my own  the details dont matter  i
want to get at the origin of the thing
the two dont even tally i spoke sharply for i had still
uncomfortably before my eyes the vision of the dead cyclist on the
stretch of empty road
they dont on this point lessing continued coolly  the jersey
devil has never to my knowledge been credited with any malevolent
intent  at the worst assuming the tales to have some basis of
truth it has merely scared one or two respectable farmers driving
home at night  now the thing that attacked me attacked me
deliberately and with an almost extraordinary ferocity of onslaught
i dont think there can be any question about that  that fact alone
puts the apparition theory out of the game  we are not dealing with
any mere visual phenomena  we are dealing with some actual existing
menace  there is just one point that can lead up to the connection
if there is one between the two
the attraction of the lamp
exactly  those other people may have been carrying a lamp or they
may not  in any case it was probably a lantern of so slight a power
as to escape notice  i said that the thing attacked me  but the
real object of its attack might very well have been the lamp and not
me at all  i merely happened in each instance to be near it
but even admitting i objected for the sake of argument that the
thing was a bat i am not certain about bats being actually attracted
by light  they blunder into it
nor am i  as i say i give you my only theory  and if you assume a
bat you must assume a bat of sufficient size to strike a man down at
one blow  the whole things grotesque  he pulled out his watch
and rose abruptly  i must get back or mary will be worrying about
me  well talk over this another time  if you go into the thing
with me well go into it thoroughly  only you know now why i warned
you against cycling with a strong lantern
even to the extent of slitting my bicycle tire
even to that extent returned lessing gravely  you see i wasnt
taking any risks
we shook hands and i followed him out to the porch  there was a
clear moon and the road glimmered white between the black line of
the woods  as i watched the swing of his shoulders down the path i
was left i admit with a definite sense of comfort at the proximity
of my own four walls  and before sleep overtook me that night the
words of the reporter came back again and again to my mind
whats the animal that goes round in these woods thats strong
enough to wreck the steel tubing of a bicycle that attacks with its
claws instead of its teeth and thats quick enough to knock a man
down without the chance of a struggle
viii
i go fishing
the next morning was one of the most glorious that i remember in that
whole summer  i rose early throwing the windows wide open while i
dressed to let in the full blaze of sunshine and set myself while
the morning commonsense mood was still upon me to go over carefully
in my mind every detail of lessings story  somewhere there must be
a natural explanation it was only the question of finding it  among
other things it occurred to me that someone for reasons unknown
might be playing a series of practical jokes upon him but it was
difficult to credit a hoax of such malignant and serious intent and
even assuming for a moment that lessing was the victim of any such
plot it did not explain those mysterious deaths which i felt more
and more convinced were in some way connected with his own
experiences
it was at least certain that i was in for a fairly interesting
vacation  i remembered with grim humour lennoxs assurance that i
would find the practice a quiet one opinions might well differ on
that point  even if lennox came back at the time agreed upon i had
still another six weeks before me and in six weeks a good deal might
happen  it would be my own fault if i did not get some part of the
mystery cleared up before then
everyone has his own private specific for clearing the mind  mine
was fishing  after breakfast i hunted out my tackle asked mrs
searle to pack me a lunch and set out resolutely with the
determination to remain in the open air until nightfall
part of the creek that lay behind the house i had already explored
and this morning i decided to work upstream in the direction of the
dam  the air was clear and fresh and the woods were alive with
birds  here and there the sumach and poison ivy were already
beginning to turn colour showing patches of tawny scarlet against
the green of the undergrowth  great painted butterflies flitted
across my path and once as i sat quietly on a boulder in midstream
a kingfisher flashed near me in the broken sunlight
the creek ran with a pleasant sound in its bed now swirling between
great boulders now trickling over shallows of waving bronzetinted
weed here and there forming deep pools outside the stress of the
current where one might catch a glimpse of shadowy forms moving
through the goldbrown sunshot water
i made desultory casts taking more interest in the morning and in my
surroundings than in the actual pursuit upon which i was engaged
out here under the trees with the music of the stream in ones ear
it was impossible to feel anything but sane and healthy
the silence of these woods was intense  in pine woods there is
always some stir of movement however faint but these trees giant
hickories and densefoliaged oaks grew so tall that sound seemed
lost amid their branches  one had the impression of miles of
farreaching solitude  to break the spell i began to whistle as i
moved upstream pausing now and then to try some likely pool picking
my way over the big rocks that dotted the bed of the stream  the
creek was fairly deep in places a child losing its footing could
be easily drowned in the strong current  it was an ideal stream for
sport but either the fish were wary this morning or i was giving but
scant attention to my task for by midday i had only one small
halfpounder and a missing hook to my score  mrs searles luncheon
packet bulged in my pocket reminding me presently of hunger  i was
reeling in preparatory to settling down by some comfortable
treetrunk when something rushed at me with a splash and a scurry
i was standing at the moment on a rounded boulder near midstream and
the impact threw me off my balance kneedeep into the water  i
turned to see the lessings orange setter
oh you bad dog a voice exclaimed from the bushes
whatever  oh doctor haverill i am so sorry
mary lessing stood on the bank bareheaded in a short golfskirt and
uprolled sleeves  the dog bounded back to her and she dealt him a
summary and ineffectual cuff on the ear
dont do that i cried  i was just thinking how cool it looked in
here anyway
i waded to the shore and joined her  i cant shake hands because
im wet i added  how are you  ive been trying to fish but the
trout here are entirely too sophisticated
youve frightened them for good now she laughed  what a shame
did you catch anything
one wretched halfpounder  i put him back for luck
a poor luck
im not so sure i rejoined smiling and she stooped hastily down
to address the setter who sat regarding us with lolling tongue
when are you going to learn manners you wretched animal  you
havent even the grace to apologize
the setter put up a muddied paw and scraped appealingly at her skirt
you deserve to go without biscuit for a month she continued  go
away from me dont shake yourself here
the command came too late and we both dodged to avoid the jubilant
shower of water drops  mary lessing shook her skirt and sat down
do you often explore up this way she asked
no  its the first time  ive no idea now how far ive come
youre about ten minutes from the dam she said  our cottage is
not very far off  i was just going back to lunch
and i was just going to have mine here  i clapped a sudden hand to
my pocket the paper parcel was still luckily intact  suppose we
were to consider it a picnic  i dont know what mrs searle has put
up for me but i have a recollection that she baked applecake
yesterday  its too entirely gorgeous a day to eat indoors
oh as for that she began
as for that you must admit that lunch indoors doesnt tempt you in
the very least
it doesnt she said  i came out here this morning because
she stopped rather abruptly  i was looking about me for a likely
spot in the shade and when i had found it at the base of two
towering hickories i pulled mrs searles parcel out from my pocket
the setter watched my proceedings with a keen interest intent on the
chance of the moment
im convinced she objected that you ought to go home and change
your boots
its impertinent i reminded her untying the pink grocery string
from the parcel to give medical advice to a doctor  do you like
uneeda biscuits  because they seem to have occupied an important
place in my housekeepers mind this morning
we sat down on the moss beneath the hickories and i divided the
single gigantic sandwich with my pocketknife  luckily mrs searle
had overestimated my hunger  we ate healthily with openair
appetites and what was left over the setter finished at one watchful
snap
when does doctor lennox come home mary asked presently
hes due in another six weeks unless he finds europe too
fascinating  then i shall have to go back and grind i suppose  it
wont be an attractive prospect after this holiday
you have a practice in new york
not yet  ive been interne up to now  i expect itll end in the
east side  a friend of mine has a settlement there and id like to
join him if i can  theres always plenty to do
i know she nodded  ive seen something of it  do you know a man
named herrick there
herrick i sat upright  if you mean jack herrick thats the
friend i was speaking of  then you
then you she corrected are the college chum he was always
talking about  why ive known jack herrick ever since i used to
play dolls
three and a half years i said pensively  the worlds a small
place
you are rude doctor haverill  its a long enough time anyway
she was looking at the branches overhead and in her upturned face i
caught fleetingly a likeness that had puzzled me more than once
before  i knew now  on herricks mantelshelf in his shabby
comfortable room at the settlement there had stood always a
photograph in a silver frame  it was the portrait of a child of
perhaps thirteen in a gingham overall and with her hair braided in
two short tails down her back  herrick had said once thats an old
sweetheart of mine
singularly enough the recollection did not at this moment greatly
please me  but i merely said
you wore your hair in two pigtails
she brought her eyes to earth swiftly  who told you
all proper little girls do at that age i reminded her shamelessly
i see  but we were talking of john herrick
go on
dont you think hes splendid she continued turning to me  hes
done no end of good  and he works  i dont believe he ever takes
a real holiday  doctor haverill you ought to get him
to come down here for a while  i willif it would please you
she looked at me so frankly that i was at once ashamed
why of course it would  but i dont know why i said that  i dont
suppose hed take the time
i watched a dragonfly that was wheeling over the stream  she sat
near me her hands locked about her knees
my brother was at your house last night she said after a moment
yes
i could feel her eyes fixed on me and i knew what was in her mind
he told you something
we were talking about chemistry i said  its a subject your
brother is very interested in
chemistry  she put out her hand with a little gesture  doctor
haverill do you take me for a child  what is the matter  you can
tell me he has spoken to you  i want to know
what do you want to know i said lamely enough
the whole thingwhat is happening here  i know something threatens
him that he is in danger and neither he nor you will tell me what
it is
how can i tell you i fenced what i dont even know myself
she was quick  then there is something
i ignored the unfinished sentence
miss lessing why cant you get your brother to go away from here
for a time
i cant  ive tried  he wouldnt leave now  you dont know him
hes the last person in the world to give a thing up until hes
proved it down to the ground one way or another  whatevers at the
bottom of this he wont rest till hes found it out  its just a
scientific problem to him and nothing else
and you i said
i  she moved her shoulders  what can i think  i had hoped just
nowbut i only know what he has told me what i have seen  if one
began to think
listen to me i said  you must not think  you and i are two sane
people  look at these wood around  i ask you is it possible to
feel anything but sane and incredulous in a place like this  i want
you to get into your head right now that there is nothingnothing
at all in this worldthat a man has any reason to be afraid of  and
there are very few things in the world to my belief that cannot be
explained  has it ever occurred to you that this whole conviction of
your brothers may be nothing more than hallucination
but the injuries
i have known hysteric patients before now inflict as severe
injuries upon themselves without consciousness or recollection  i
dont say it is your brothers case im only trying to form a
possible rational explanation such as any doctor would put forward
i have had one or two such cases within my own experience  what i
propose to do is this but i shall do it only with your consent  i
will write to herrick and ask him down here for a fortnight  it will
be a new brain to bear on the problem and i shall ask your brother
to let us join these investigations with him
youll do that  she put out her hand to me impulsively
ill do it tonight  only  i shall have to give herrick a
detailed account of everything that has happened so far as we know
it and i cant do that without your brothers approval
yes  i see
you will excuse one question  are they on good terms
it struck me that i had never heard lessing mention his name
yes  she paused doubtfully  its funny you should ask that
they had a disagreement about two years ago  it was when my brother
first took up this  this kind of study  having seances and that
doctor herrick wanted him to give it up
i moved involuntarily  here was a new light on lessings attitude of
mind which he himself had been at pains it seemed to me to touch
on very lightly  i remembered stray references of his the signed
article i had noticed on my first evening at the house
your brother used to attend seances often
didnt he tell you  i dont know that i would have mentioned it
but i dont see that it matters  it was before i came to live with
them  he and some friends of his were very interested and doctor
herrick used to join them too sometimes  they met at a friends
studio  doctor herrick was rather against it from the first but i
know he used to be there  of course i understand very little about
it but  things did happen  i dont mean that they banged on
tambourines or rapped out the alphabet or anything like that  it
wasnt spiritualism  and then doctor herrick stopped  i think he
knew more than any of them but he said it was dangerous and it
didnt lead to anything and he wanted my brother to give it up
altogether  katethats my sisterinlaw you knowwas their
medium and i think it was on her account  doctor herrick thought it
was bad for her  and then one night something happened i dont know
just what but kate got some sort of a shock  shes very highly
strung at any time and i always supposed something frightened her
but anyway she was quite ill for a long time after that  she used to
get queer sort of nervous spells and she couldnt be left alone and
that was why i first came to live with them on her account  of
course my brother gave the whole business up then  the physician who
attended her said simply that she was in poor health and had had a
nervous breakdown and he told her she must live in the country
awhile till she got stronger but i know doctor herrick thought at
the time that the seances had been the cause of it  he told my
brother so
i listened attentively  it was news to me that herrick the
essential levelheaded should have lent himself at any time to
experiments of this order  he had never mentioned the subject to me
in our many talks and i had even gathered as one gathers an
impression without any very definite grounds that he was a confirmed
sceptic on all matters of occultism
you say they had a disagreement
it was exactly that she made haste to say they didnt quarrel
but i know herrick was very much opposed to dicks views and they
used to have arguments  but it didnt amount to more than that
good
she had risen to her feet and at her movement the setter himself
lazily rose and came towards us
then were going to see this thing out i said
well see it out
we shook hands and i fancied that her fingers rested in mine a
moment voluntarily before she drew them away
are you coming up to see my brother today she asked
presently  id like to  i looked at my watch  i thought of
taking a stroll up to the dam as im so close ive never been
there  you say its only a few minutes
not more than ten through the woods
lets walk up together i suggested if you arent too tired
she assented readily and we struck off up a little footpath barely
traceable that followed the course of the stream  it was as she
had said a scant ten minutes before the sound of the sluice broke on
our ears and through a sudden clearing of the woods the dam lay
before us a black sinister sheet of water covered with masses of
floating weed and pondlilies and darkened by the trees and
underbrush that grew closely down to its edge  an old scow long
past use and sunken low in the water lay padlocked to a slimy stump
near the shore
following an old carttrack we skirted the edge of the dam in the
direction of the sawmill a dilapidated building with broken roof
that seemed to have stood for many years of disuse  to reach it we
had to cross the sluice itself and mary lessing who was a few paces
ahead of me paused to look down over the single rough handrail that
protected one from a misstep
there is something forbidding about a millsluice at any time
especially when dissociated as this was from the companionable
sound of human labour  the sheer depth the knowledge of the vast
imprisoned force behind one the sound of water gushing here and
there between the slimy weedgrown timbers give always to me at
least an indefinable sense of the sinister
i leaned my rod against the railing and we looked down side by side
at the black oozing wall below
i like this place mary lessing said  theres something queer and
creepy about it  i often come here  i suppose they havent worked
the sluice for years
i doubt if the machinery would move now i said  of course this
is never opened  there should be a smaller sluice for the millstream
further on
i glanced as i spoke at the clumsy wooden levers near me that
controlled the sluice  they looked to be rotting in their place but
as i pushed one idly a sudden change in the sound of escaping water
below warned me that the machinery was not in such ill repair as it
would seem  i exerted my strength to pull the lever back and my
attention was momentarily distracted from the girl beside me  she
was leaning out over the handrail and when i turned it was with a
sudden cry of warning
look out i said  that may not be safe
i caught her arm instinctively as i spoke and on the instant the
rail bent outward with a slight sound of cracking  in another moment
she would have been over the edge  we looked at one another and
mary laughed a little nervously on the stillness  her face had
flushed
i thought that rail was all right she said rather awkwardly
dick walked over here with me not a week ago and we tested it then
to see
it isnt all right now i returned sharply
i put my two hands on the rail giving it a slight wrench outward
it gave easily to my touch and looking closer i saw that the
surface towards the water had been half cut through  someone had
tampered with it deliberately and within the last few days
what is it mary lessing asked
merely rotten as i thought
i turned away and walked thoughtfully on towards the sawmill  the
thing puzzled me but it had an ugly look  it was no idle mischief
that had prompted the act  whoever had done it had done it
maliciously and the purpose was not very far to seek  hitherto i
had not attached much importance to the lessings occasional laughing
references to their unpopularity in the village  now it assumed
suddenly a significance
i turned to mary lessing walking beside me
i want you to promise me something i said whether it seems to
you irrelevant or not  i want you not to come here again by
yourself at any time  its a lonely place and it isnt particularly
safe  if you come at all bring your brother with you
the smile that was on her lips at first faded abruptly leaving her
face serious
the rail was cut she said quietly  is that what you mean  it
must have been because it was perfectly solid a few days ago
someone has been up to mischief  if there are characters of that
kind in the neighbourhood its best to run no risks thats all
we walked on a few paces silently  the mill was on our right a
desolatelooking building enough with its surrounding litter of
sodden chips and piles of cut logs lying here and there in the open
a heavy smell of decaying wood was in the air added to the stagnant
odour of the dam itself
the setter was in front of us sniffing to and fro on the trail of
the rats that infested the wood piles  suddenly he stood still his
ears laid back growling ominously  a short thickset figure
slipped from the angle of the mill wall and vanished in the woods on
the farther side of the carttrack
aaron menning miss lessing said  she put her hand and called the
dog back  i was staring up the track where the chickenhuckster had
so adroitly disappeared
does he live near here
not very far off  i suppose he comes here to fish  there are a
good many in the dam
very probable i said
i dislike that man mary said after a moment  i guess its
mutual too  the other one jake you know had a quarrel with my
brother one time  he was always loitering round the house and dick
turned him away  aarons always very civil when we meet but i dont
believe he likes us any more than jakey did
we took a turning past the mill that led us without further event
to the lessings bungalow  within sight of the house i parted from
her  i wanted to see lessing again but there were a few points that
needed readjustment in my own mind first  as i walked slowly home
down the familiar slope of dutchmans hill i was thinking that the
industrious and chapelgoing aaron might very well bear a little
watching
ix
problems
i wrote to herrick that same evening and his answer came a couple of
days later saying that he hoped to get away towards the end of the
month  i had said nothing in my letter about the events of the
summer but merely mentioned that the lessings were my neighbours for
the time being
herrick wrote i shall be glad to meet lessing again  he seems to
have buried himself in obscurity for the last twelve months  is he
still as enthusiastic a theorist as ever or has the country sobered
his ideas  in any case you are to be congratulated on having for
neighbours three of the most charming people it has ever been my luck
to meet
i smiled at the three  in my own mind i could have substituted
another numeral which would explain much of herricks promptitude in
accepting my invitation  he was very much mistaken if he thought
that any such artless device would put me off the track  in
imagination i already saw myself playing the role of a reluctant
gooseberry during his visit
lessing when i mentioned my expected guest made a comment almost
identical with herricks own
herrick he said  good  we shall have some arguments haverill
that will eclipse even your own  if herrick gets to the bottom of
this by any of his cutanddried theories and deductions ill give
him best once and for all
one thing at least pleased me  i gathered from both their remarks
that whatever difference had occurred between them had been purely a
battle of opinion and had no influence on their fundamental regard
for one another  meantime my meeting with mary lessing and the
subsequent incident of the broken handrail had settled my mind on
one point at least  there was some malicious influence at work in
the neighborhood which was distinctly and obviously human whether it
bore any relation to the laboratory experiences or not and at any
cost even if necessary in the face of lessings opposition she must
be kept clear of it
threefourths of the neighbouring population were pennsylvania dutch
and i had learned enough in my own infrequent dealings with them to
recognize their sullen aloofness amounting almost to a hostility
towards any stranger settled in their midst  the lessings were for
some reason disliked in the village and i fancied that much of the
distrust towards them was due to their having chosen for their
dwelling a spot which already had a sufficiently bad reputation in
the eyes of the country people about  lessing was by no means the
sort of man to make himself popular here or even friendly  he was
more or less of a recluse he had erected a mysterious building in
which engaged upon equally mysterious pursuits he chose to isolate
himself until all hours of the night and he displayed an open
indifference towards all the current gossip and superstition of the
neighbourhood  following the primitive psychology of these people
narrowminded to a degree and distrustful of anything unfamiliar his
habits alone were sufficient to brand him as an ungodly character
according to his sister he had already fallen foul of jake menning
soon after his arrival and i had no doubt whatever that aaron out
of revenge had since done his best to foster the already
antagonistic feeling towards him  the hucksters trade lends itself
to all the backdoor gossip of the countryside and it seemed to me
that i could trace easily enough the fruit of aarons housetohouse
visits  aaron himself was civilspoken industrious religious to
all accounts and a highly respected member of the community but all
this did not weigh very far against the mans face  whatever ill
blood ran in the menning family it was certainly not confined to the
deceased jakey
i mentioned my suspicions to lessing a day or two later when i was
at the bungalow
oh the mans right enough he returned  i dont like his kind
thats all  i had a row with jakey because i didnt want him hanging
round the place and i told him so  aaron has never annoyed us in any
way on the contrary he takes pains to be particularly civil  i
think hes like all the rest around glad enough to keep clear of
dutchmans hill and all its inhabitants dead or living
mary lessing had asked me on our homeward walk not to mention the
cut railing to her brother and i had not done so  it was sufficient
for the moment that she had agreed to keep away from the milldam and
its immediate neighbourhood  she was a sensible girl and i had no
fear that she would break her promise out of any spirit of bravado or
curiosity
we were in the sittingroom  mary had gone down to the village on an
errand and mrs lessing was as usual invisible  for the time being
we were free from interruption and it struck me as a good moment to
tell lessing what i had heard from the reporter concerning the two
mysterious cycling fatalities
he took it even more seriously than i had expected  it was even with
scant patience that he heard me out
but good heavens man he cried why didnt you tell me all this
sooner  dont you see that its what ive been expecting what ive
been watching the papers for month after month  it puts my
experience clear of all doubt  i have felt certainas certain as i
am standing herethat sooner or later some accident of this sort
would turn up
it was a good fifteen miles from here i said  besides
whats fifteen miles  i dont care if it was fifty  have you got
the cutting with you
i had  i had torn off the corner with the paragraph unobserved of
my reporter friend and i took the fragment now from my pocketbook
and gave it to lessing  he read it through eagerly
the facts correspond  the man was killed in the open he had no
chance of shelter  the thing hit him as he was riding
its not proved
theres the damage to the bicycle
theres exactly that i said which to my mind puts a different
light on the whole thing  if the impact of the blow was sufficient
to damage the bicycle to that extent how was it that the rider
escaped all injury except a single scratch on the face  its out of
all reason  there were no marks on the body  that is testified to
if a man is knocked off his bicycle while riding at even an average
speed hell have some marks to show for it  he died from heart
failure probably resultant upon fright and the shock of the wound
very good  but that doesnt account for the bicycle  it seems to me
that whatever attacked him wreaked its spite on the machine
afterwards
he had time to dismount
possibly  it doesnt say how near to the bicycle he was lying  if
he fell at all he must have fallen clear of it  the lamp was picked
up several yards away
the lamp said lessing
the same thought was in both our minds
what date did this happen he asked
it was a weekold paper  i was there  wait a moment  i made a
rough calculation in my mind  this happened apparently on the
thursday previous  that should bring it to about the third of the
month
the third was a thursday said lessing  he pulled out an almanac
from the bookshelves and ran the pages over  i saw him frown
there was a full moon on that evening  it is just possible he was
riding without a light at all  if so that throws my whole theory
out
the whole thing said i looks to me like the work of a maniac
take the lamp  it was picked up some yards away  now a bicycle
lantern isnt merely hung on its screwed on and you cant imagine
any sort of blow struck from above that would dislodge it and throw
it that distance  it must have been either unscrewed or torn off
deliberately and that in itself suggests human agency
lessing barely heard me  he was staring at the scrap of paper spread
out on his knee
the first man according to your reporter was killed actually in the
woods  the second was picked up some twenty feet from the edge of
the woods on the open road  thats important  it was a clear
night  why should he be attacked in the open when there were woods
within half a dozen yards that would have given ample ambush
unconsciously he was repeating the reporters argument  that
doesnt look like the work of a human being  besides the man wasnt
robbed  i tell you haverill theres something that doesnt satisfy
me in all this  either they made some extraordinary mistake or 
but he was riding towards the woods
apparently
on what evidence
i suppose the position of the bicycle i said lamely
there had been no rain for some days  the roads are hard about
here and a bicycle wouldnt be likely to leave tracks especially on
the edge of the path  youre a doctor haverill  suppose a man died
from heart failure would he necessarily die at the instant of the
shock
only in romances  actually there would be several seconds
interval at least
he might run say twenty feet and then drop
quite possibly  but i dont see how that helps
it means just this said lessing that according to my idea the
man was not riding towards the woods at all  he was attacked
actually in the woods or at the edge of them and he ran the twenty
feet to where his body was found  listen  the moon did not rise
that evening until 1030  anyone riding through the woods the
earlier part of the evening would have used a lamp  he was a
stranger in the district and was identified only by papers  no one
in coopersville knew him or had apparently ever seen him before
coopersville is not a large place and a case like this makes
sufficient talk  if he had passed through there during the evening
someone would have seen him and it would have been mentioned at the
inquest  the chances are that he had come from a distance and that
he was riding towards coopersville with the idea of putting up
there for the night  assuming that and that he was carrying a lamp
at the time we have our facts fairly clear  he was attacked just
within cover of the woods that is to say where the light would be
more clearly noticeable than on an open stretch of moonlit road  the
overhanging trees would break the attack more or less which accounts
for the comparative slightness of his own injury  the primary object
of attack being the lamp the rider would have the chance of escape
whereas if he had been struck actually in the open at full force he
would have been probably killed on the spot
the whole theory was fairly ingenious but it didnt account for the
wrecking of the bicycle for its being found where it was some
distance clear of the woods and near the mans own body  i told
lessing so  he looked at me queerly
have you ever seen a dog worry a stick he asked
we arent dealing with dogs
whatever wrecked the bicycle could have dragged it that distance
if your theory has anything in it the bicycle was carried  if it
had been dragged they would have found traces  dont tell me that
any animal capable of such insensate fury as you suggest would have
had the intelligence to conceal its tracks
we were both getting rather heated over the argument  it seemed to
me that lessing was bent obstinately on maintaining his own views to
the point of extravagance  for my part i was equally positive that
the affair was due to some human agency  neither of us therefore
was aware of a shadow in the doorway until mary lessings pleasant
mocking voice broke in upon our discussion
what on earth she said are you two people scrapping about so
vehemently
we werent scrapping i smiled  we were discussing a problemyou
might call it a scientific riddle  it concerns the law which governs
the movement of bodies through space
mary turned on me her invariable reproachful glance when she
suspected that anyone was making fun of her  she sat down pulling
the pins from her hat and let the sunlight strike on her roughened
bronzecoloured hair
is it anything she inquired with which my inferior feminine mind
might be capable of grappling
certainly i returned promptly  we will illustrate it with the
simple objects now before us  how would it be possible for
instance for that extremely solid bookcase to be moved say to the
other end of the room without being dragged or carried
mary affected to consider her head on one side
simple enough she said laughing  it would have to fly through
the air thats all
there was a moments silence in the room while i looked at lessing
and he looked at me
suppose we have some tea he said then
x
the chickenhucksters house
it was the last weekend in august that herrick arrived  for nearly
two days before it had rained steadily and i had spent the time
indoors discounting old scores in the shape of letters and
enlivened only by a visit from lessing who walked over in oilskins
on the thursday afternoon to spend a couple of hours smoking on a
sheltered corner of the front porch  the weather lifted on friday
night and by saturday morning the roads were passable  as i did not
expect herrick before the 540 train i took my bicycle out after
lunch and went for a spin to stretch my limbs
i set out by way of the village posting my letters on the way and
intending to make a circuit that would bring me home from the
opposite direction  i managed however to lose my bearings and
after some fruitless bungling stopped at a farmhouse to ask my way
the farmer seemed rather less taciturn than most of the folk about
and readily pointed me out a short cut which according to him would
bring me out at the cross roads just above the dam
the road which lay for the first few miles through cultivated land
entered eventually upon a stretch of sparsely wooded country
desolate and inhospitable enough  stunted spruce trees powdered
with blue berries clung tenaciously to the barren ground and
everywhere the grey monotonous boulders cropped out scattered as
though in the idle finish to some giants play  their uncouth
rounded outlines suggested from a distance a field dotted with grey
misshapen sheep for ever movelessly browsing  the road was bad a
horse would have had difficulty in picking his way and i cursed the
wellmeaning farmer roundly as i dismounted to push my heavy machine
a little distance on however things became better  i reached the
beginning of a wood gaunt ragged hickories interspersed with tangles
of wild grapevine and matted creepers and a few hundred yards
beyond a broken snakefence suggested the whereabouts of a house
i came upon it at the turn of the road a square redpainted frame
house and barn surrounded by a medley of small sheds and outhouses
in every degree of dilapidation  there was no gate merely a couple
of bars let down in the fencing and i left the bicycle a moment and
went inside
the yard upon which i entered was a litter of old junk of every
description ancient packingcases broken barrels scrapiron and
bones flung into piles  the wagonruts leading up to the house were
sunken deep in filth and an indescribable odour filled the air in
which the smell of badly kept fowls predominated  they ran
everywhere a ragged nondescript crew scratching cackling gazing
at me from evil yellowrimmed eyes  many more were confined in the
coops mere oblong boxes of lath from which protruded gaunt heads and
outstretched necks whose mournful protest mingled with the clamour
of their untrammelled brethren  so far as i could see every shed
held its prisoners all in the same state of filth and neglect a
sore to the eyes and offence to the nostrils  there was that in the
look and smell of the place that stuck in my throat used as i was to
poverty in both town and country  there seemed no one about and
after a moments hesitation i retraced my steps across the black mire
of the yard and regained the roadway
on the opposite side of the way a little ragged girl of about
thirteen watched my retreat with keen eyes  she had been in the
woods gathering the small uneatable nuts that children call
pighickories her apron was filled with the green unripe hulls  she
grinned backing a little at my approach
hello sis i said  who lives in that house there
s mister mennings
ah  i took another backward glance at the illkept yard with its
indescribable litter  as i did so a low moan almost human in its
misery came from the barn behind the jumbled sheds  it was
repeated longdrawn and mournful the protest of a dumb thing
exhausted by suffering  i turned to the child sharply
whats the matter there
its the cow  she shuffled her bare toes in the dust looking with
a fascinated curiosity towards the place whence the sound came  she
hollers awful sometimes
is it ill
mennin beats her  she said with the curious indifference of the
countrybred child towards animal suffering  hes allus beatin
her  granpaps spoke to him onct  he says she dont make no
profit an granpa says she cant make no profit if hes allus
beatin her
i remembered her face suddenly
arent you mrs nevills little girl from the bend
yep  granpas house is jest back there  she jerked her head up
the road
hows your mother  ill step in and see her as im here
mothers up  shes been washin
she began to retreat up the road with the sudden movement of a
halfwild thing and i followed her glad enough to turn my back on
the chickenhucksters dwelling  the moaning of the cow was in my
ears again as i walked on
i knew the nevills cottage and my road from there lay straight
enough  i had never approached the bend before from this side and
so the lie of the land was unfamiliar to me  the nevills were one of
the few irish families about  the household consisted of a rheumatic
old grandfather his daughter whom i had attended a short while ago
and her husband a steady young fellow who worked at a harness
factory in the village
paddy was an old sinner if there ever lived one but now along in
the green seventies he confined himself to the cultivation of
religion and the smoking of a particularly vile corncob pipe  he had
been employed most of his life on the railway and his rheumatism was
the result of six weeks work in a flooded cutting  providence had
released him some two years ago from a vituperative wife whose
latter years had been soured by the burden of an invalid husband i
gathered from the old mans talk that she had to her last day
regarded his rheumatism as a form of criminal idleness and since her
death paddy had taken a fresh lease of life
i found him on his usual corner of the cottage porch his square old
head with its bristly jawspaddy still shaved once a weekframed by
the windowledge and its row of flowering plants in tin cans  his
daughter was inside getting supper and the new baby lay in a
ramshackle babycoach near paddys elbow  he was rocking the coach
with one toe on the wheel while he smoked the smell of his
unspeakable tobacco mingling with that of the frying onions in the
kitchen through the open door
i always felt like holding my breath when i approached the nevill
cottage  the stuffiness was of that permanent impenetrable sort
which seems to encompass the house solidly for a radius of five yards
at least
i sat down on the porch step and asked after paddys rheumatism  he
looked down at his feet shapeless in list slippers like fearsome
parcels
i aint long fur this world doctor and thats truth im tellin
yer  dont i know it  we aint a longlived famly  me father died
at seventyeight an me brother at eighty an im thinkin i wont
be long after thim  he raised his voice suddenly to a shout
without turning mary git a cheer out fur th doctor
i refused the chair hastily the porch step at least bordered on
fresh air
ive just come round by aaron mennings place i said  i met the
little girl there
paddys face darkened
aint i allus tellin the young limb i wont hev her hangin round
the likes of thim dirrty dutchmen  its her motherll be after
takin the strap to her fur that  the place aint fit fur a dog
these days  did ye take heed to the cow there
i nodded
the poor baste do be after cryin day an night like a christian
ive told him again an again but hes a bad man is aaron  hes
took after his brother an thats sayin ill enough of anyone  ye
wouldnt mind jake mennin doctor
no  it was before i came here
sure ive lived neighbors to thim fifteen years an ive seen
things to turn your stomach on yer  he had a bad streak in him
jake an it was the devil took him in the end  they had a little
girl there workin the year before jake died  thats why i tell
lizzie ill break her neck before i see her hangin round there  the
ould mothers a decent woman or used to be  god knows the poor
souls had enough to turn her crazy
there is a mother then
sure but ye dont see her nowadays  tis aaron keeps her to the
house most like  i used to be civil spoke to aaron a while back
but sence jake died there aint no good to him at all  would any
christian man treat a dumb baste the way he does  an he treats his
ould mother the same if alls known
he pulled on his pipe
two weeks ago it would be as we saw her last  yes i mind now it
was the day i was thinkin of puttin the new winderpane in  she
come over to borry a halfcup o sugar an i says to mary to let her
have it the poor soul  she had her hand all wrapped up to herehe
measured a space on his gaunt grimy wristan she says to mary as
shed scalded it in the kitchen  aaron was away with the wagon or
she wouldnt a come then
i suppose aaron does a good business i said casually
by the talk he does  i do be thinkin he does most of it in the
next county fur i dont see him drivin the village way moren onct
in a week or so  hell be gone three days on a stretch wid the
wagon an lizzies seen him come home mornins wid the poor baste in
a lather  lizzie says he has hundreds o chickens there an he
cant be after sellin thim all  they die on him all the time fur
shes seen him pull em out o the coops and throw em to the pigs
i asked after his son and rose to go after turning the half of my
tobacco pouch into paddys old tin box  it was getting on toward
five oclock and i would have just time to clean up get the mare
put in and drive to the depot for the afternoon train
xi
jakey walks
it did me good to see herricks cheery face on the platform and to
feel the handgrip he gave me  our friendship dated back to college
days and unlike so many of those early intimacies it had
strengthened instead of decreased with the passage of time  then as
now herrick had been the same curious mixture of enthusiast and
practical hardheaded worker and in spite of the inevitable
schooling of experience and years of exacting and often discouraging
labour he had carried into the early forties a certain boyish
confidence a freshness of outlook which gave to one instinctively
on meeting him the impression of indomitable health and vitality
when we had tucked his valise into the back of the buggy and turned
the mare about he looked at me with a laugh
well haverill you look quite the country practitioner already
seven weeks changeye gods  but you havent grown a beard yet
im keeping the beard for my leisure moments i told him  so far
they havent been many
dont tell me this place is in the throes of an epidemic  it looks
like one of those ideal sleepy hollows where you get about one call
for whoopingcough every six months  i came here for repose you
know
oh youll get it i assured him  youll get the kind of repose
that keeps you awake nights wondering where its going to hit you
next  they dont want a doctor down here they want a new lunacy
commission officer and the first suspect will be me  oh im going
to make you work jack  have no idle dreams on the subject
work  you look as if youd forgotten the meaning of the word  if
ever a man had the luck to stumble on a good excuse for a holiday
its you  this air this sky these woods to fish and loaf in
hello whats up  the whoopingcough i spoke of or have you
arranged a little semblance of business for my benefit  that good
lady seems about to welcome us with open arms
a woman was hurrying down the road toward us from the direction of
my house  she had a gingham sunbonnet on which flapped at each step
as she walked and on catching sight of the buggy with the familiar
roan mare in the shafts she waved her hand in unmistakable signal  i
pulled bess up and by the time the woman came pantingly abreast of
us i recognized her for mrs sliefer who lived in the first
farmhouse beyond the bend past the cross roads
i been to your house doctor she began an mis searle told me
you werent to hum so i come right on  my niece is took bad an
shes been queer sence the mornin and id like you to come straight
back with me an see her
she spoke with an air somewhat of indignation born of her toilsome
walk  mrs sliefer was a stout lady to put it at the mildest and
the heat and exercise had obviously tried her  i leaned from the
buggy
get right up mrs sliefer  theres plenty of room and you can
tell me as we drive
she hoisted herself laboriously into the buggy with our combined
help and collapsed rather than sat down between us  luckily the
seat was a broad one  as it was her generous proportions all but
crushed us
i kept the mare at a walk while mrs sliefer told her errand
briefly as i gathered from her rather spasmodic utterance the facts
were these
her niece rebecca durn who lived with mr and mrs sliefer at the
farm was keeping company with the young man from haskells grocery
store  the young couple were in the habit of meeting of an evening
after rebecca had washed her supper dishes in the woods near the
sawmill some fifteen minutes from the farmhouse and in the line of
the short cut which the young man used to walk up from the village
they usually took a short stroll about the dam before returning to
the farm to finish the evening in the older folks company on the
home porch  yesterday as i have said was rainy and rebecca had
expected her sweetheart at the house  as he did not arrive however
and the weather had lifted since five oclock rebecca thinking he
might possibly have gone to the usual trystingplace put on a shawl
and her rubber shoes and went out to find him  he was not to seen
and she loitered a few moments in the neighborhood of the dam before
returning home  it was then just getting dusk  according to her
account she was strolling near the sawmill when the ghost of jakey
menning surrounded by light and with flames coming from his mouth
sprang out from the bushes and yelled at her  rebecca struck of a
heap as she expressed it had still the sense to turn and run and
being a sturdy young woman she speedily outdistanced the alleged
ghost and gained the shelter of her own home  once on the porch
however she collapsed in hysterics and it was not until she came
to a good halfhour after that her aunt and uncle could learn what
had happened  rebeccas sweetheart had meantime arrived and being a
strongminded young man had at once induced mr sliefer to set out
with him armed with a stout cudgel and the farmers shotgun to
investigate  they patrolled the neighborhood of the sawmill
thoroughly but needless to say nothing was found
rebecca recovered but this morning on the matter being mentioned at
breakfast had promptly gone off again into hysterics a state which
had lasted all day off and on and which her aunt had been unable to
check  the hysteria had brought on sickness and the girl so mrs
sliefer told me was now in bed in a state of utter collapse
i told herrick i would drop him at the house
on the contrary he returned ill come along with mrs sliefers
permission
we drove on accordingly the three of us covering the distance past
dutchmans hill and the lessings bungalow at a smart trot  a few
minutes beyond the sawmill along the road mary lessing and i had
taken some mornings ago the sliefers farmhouse came in sight a
comfortable lowbuilt dwelling standing back in a goodsized orchard
with the barn and outbuildings clustered near it
we found rebecca in an upper bedroom watched over by a mute and
scaredlooking neighbor who had been fetched in to sit with her
while her aunt was away  the girl lay in bed her eyes rolling her
hands twitching nervously on the covers  there was nothing alarming
in her condition which had been brought about as much by mrs
sliefers wellmeant home physicking as by the original fright
i went to the bedside and put my hand on her wrist
now then i said whats all this nonsense about bogies  a big
strong girl like you ought to have better sense than to imagine such
things
she began to whimper
i seen iti seen it  it was all spoutin fire  it was jakey
menning as sure as theres a livin god  ohhi dont want to look
at it  i dont want to
she went off into another hysterical spasm and it took all my force
to hold her still while her aunt went for water  when it was over
and she lay back on the pillows still sobbing exhaustedly i took
mrs sliefer aside
give me pen and ink i said and have someone drive down to the
drug store with this prescription at once  ill wait here till its
brought back  your niece will probably be all right tomorrow after
a nights sleep but keep her in bed a day in any case
she took the prescription and gave it to her husband  we heard his
heavy boots creaking out to the back door  i turned to mrs sliefer
and now i said youre a clever sensible woman  whats your
idea of all this nonsense
mrs sliefer was obviously flattered by my description  she mopped
her flat round face still shining from the walk
rebecca aint no liar she said  shes a good upstandin girl
an she aint never showed no foolishness before this  we was
talking about dutchmans hill ony a few nights ago and rebecca was
the first to laugh about it  id like to see the ghostd scare me
she said right there  no  rebecca seen suthin or she wouldnt ha
come home the state she did  an as for its bein jakey shed
oughter know jakey mennin well enough seein hes brought the wagon
round here time an agn when aaron was busy
you dont tell me you believe in the foolish talk theres been mrs
sliefer
she stiffened
no an i aint sayin i do but sperrits or no sperrits mr
sliefers goin to get to the bottom of this  seems to me there a
law had ought to deal with respectable girls bein frightened out of
their wits ten yards from their own doorstep
listen i said  it seems that your niece has been the victim of a
very cruel and foolish practical joke but theres no good going into
the matter here and now  only look after her  if anyone is playing
tricks around the sawmill keep her away from there  shes in no
state to risk any more shocks  dont let her go wandering about
alone
i wouldnt ha let her last night ony she was so sure of findin
george freeman there  rebecca was born an brought up here and she
knows the woods as well as our own front yard  but therell be an
end of these doins an i told her so
thats right  i paused a moment  who was here the evening that
your niece spoke of not being frightened
only us an mis scholl there an george freeman  there wasnt one
of em would play a trick on her  an george freeman was in at the
house aready when rebecca come runnin back
i did not leave until the farmer returned and i had seen rebecca
already quiet and subdued under the influence of the sleeping draught
i had prescribed for her  then herrick and i drove home through the
dusk to the ruined supper which mrs searle had prepared so
painstakingly for six oclock
well i said to him what do you make of it
herrick smiled
ghosts dont usually holler he said and rebecca seems to have
been very clear on the hollering if on nothing else  i think we may
dismiss the theory of the defunct jakey  and by the way who was
jakey menning and what is this extraordinary tangle about a place
called dutchmans hill
i gave the mare a light touch with the whip
we are passing dutchmans hill at this moment i said and ill
give you the history over our supper
xii
mr crowfoot
i outslept herrick by a good hour the next morning in fact he was
already up and out by the time i came down to a belated breakfast  i
had one call to make in the village and after that herrick being
still absent i sat down on the porch with my pipe and a newspaper to
await his return
there was no mail for me at the office only a couple of letters for
herrick forwarded from new york and as i slipped these in my pocket
i wondered again at the curious silence of lennox  since that short
note from queenstown i had heard nothing from him and he had
neglected even to provide me with the promised address by which i
could communicate with him in case of need an oversight by which he
had certainly secured to himself a free and uninterrupted holiday
and which left me no choice meantime but to await his return or such
news as he might ultimately choose to send  i must admit that
lessings phrase bolted stuck unpleasantly in my mind little as it
accorded with my estimate of lennoxs character  his haste to be
off the lack of any communication from him since had more than a
look of flight but why or from what he had bolted i was still at a
loss to understand
i was still turning this over in my mind when herrick sauntered into
view down the road accompanied by a stranger  visitors were
sufficiently rare in the neighbourhood and as the two approached the
house leisurely i studied the newcomer with some curiosity  he was
a small man of apparently some fifty years sparsely bearded and
dressed in a very shabby knickerbocker suit of greenish tweeds  a
soft felt hat covered his head and at least half his forehead he
wore dark glasses and carried a botanical collectingbox slung over
his shoulder  there was something quaintly rabbitlike in his
appearance enhanced by the air of timidity with which he hung back
while herrick strode forward to the porch to greet me
i want to introduce mr crowfoot herrick said with a gesture
which had an effect of herding the mild little man up to the porch
step as he might have herded some curious and inoffensive zoological
specimen  he is down here hunting orchids and i came across him in
the woods and brought him along to have a chat with you  you might
be able to give him some hints about the country
i shook hands with the little man and gave him a chair on the porch
where he settled himself shyly his collectingbox across his knee
im afraid i dont know much about the flora round here i said
but i imagine mr crowfoot will find a good deal to interest him
oh i am only an amateur said the little man  i s  i s
i ss
he undoubtedly did and the reason for his shyness stood forthwith
revealed  he stammered and had more than the usual sensitiveness of
his infirmity
ssimply indulge a hobby he finished heroically  it gives me an
object for my leisure time  i ss presume you have lived here
some time mr
haverilldoctor haverill herrick prompted
haverill  he repeated it in a certain childlike way as though to
place the name definitely in his memory and immediately i was
conscious of a liking for him  he was at once so diffident and so
meticulously polite
on the contrary ive been here only a month or so taking a
friends place for the time  the country about is delightful so far
as i know it
delightful he echoed and lapsed into a pleased silence which
lasted so long that herrick rose
i want to change my shoes he said  ive been up to the neck in
bog  i dont know our resources austin but i guess we can offer
mr crowfoot a drink
wateri should llike very much a plain glass of water said the
little botanist
and a cigar at all events i supplemented  i should have some
pretty decent cigars somewhere around that my predecessor left here
look in the drawer in the surgery jack will you
herrick reappeared a moment later with the box
excellent said our new friend as he helped himself  excellent
apparently you dddont care for these cigars then doctor haverill
i laughed  oh i only smoke a pipe as a rule
you make if i may ssay so a great error he said gravely
he smoked for a few moments tranquilly his gaze behind the dark
glasses seeming to rest dreamily on the stretch of road before the
house
i suppose you are staying in the village i asked
over there  he made a vague gesture which included half the
visible landscape  with some excellent people of the name of
sssliefer
oh sliefers i said interested  i know them slightly  the big
farmhouse past the sawmill
precisely he agreed and gave me a look before relapsing again
into silence
our conversation if it could be called so languished  it was
evident to me that his shyness was battling with the desire to be
offi judged that herrick had fairly dragged him here out of a
mistaken cordialityand after the exchange of a few more spasmodic
sentences i accepted his courteous and timid explanation that the
sliefers dined at midday and would be expecting him back and rose to
shake hands
a queer chicken said herrick as we watched his jerky little figure
disappear down the road  i picked him up back in the woods there
grubbing around the sawmill and brought him along for your
benefita quaint example of the pennsylvanian fauna  timidicus
professus or grounddwelling googoo bird  difficult of approach
and does not thrive in captivity  guess hes more than a bit batty
by his looks
mrs sliefer never mentioned a boarder i remarked  he must be a
new arrival  its to be hoped he wont come to any grief in his
grubbing around as you call it
oh the gods protect the innocent laughed herrick  even the
alleged ghost of jakey menning would have pity  by the way the fair
rebeccas tale is still firmly believed in by the sliefers at any
rate  the latest village version is that she was chased clear to the
garden fence and that her skirt still shows five scorched prints
where the ghostly fingers clutched  the neighbourhood must have been
quite worked up  it was bad enough when jakey had the decency to
keep to one place at least but now he has taken like the wind to
blowing where he listeth folks are getting scary  i got that much
from our guileless little friend though he professes himself to be
quite indifferent on the subject  of course you as the village
doctor are above such gossip so i thought id go gleaning for you
someones doing it i said
of course someone did in the case of rebecca at least  real ghosts
dont holler as i said before and the bluefire details smell
strongly of the common or garden matchbox  but as our little
professorbird spends most of his time in the woods about there i
thought his observations might come in useful
private detective eh
herrick smiled
oh im sufficiently interested in the lessing problem to be anxious
to clear out the undergrowth if you follow me  that done one can
judge a bit more clearly  if theres any foolery going on well run
it to the ground and crowfoot may come in useful there
ive a good notion i said knocking my pipe out to try some
watching round that locality myself one of these nights
it wouldnt be any good he returned for the simple reason that
jakey wouldnt demonstrate to you or me any more than hes
demonstrated to lessing  he chooses those he wants to favour  as a
matter of fact by the aid of my bedroom window the convenience of
which you have probably underestimated austin i spent last night
prowling myself  no i didnt let you into it because i wanted to be
alone  needless to say there was nothing doing  but ive found out
one thing  theres someone else interested in the game besides us
i dont know who  but we narrowly escaped collision and gave each
other mutually a wide berth
it couldnt have been the ghost himself whoever he is
i think not  it was too obvious we were both out on the same
errand  like the irishman we each thought we were someone else and
when we met it was neither of us  he smiled at the recollection
well i suppose well get at the root of the thing some day
xiii
an afternoon drive
it was towards the end of that week that we drove over to the
bungalow one afternoon for tea  the teacups were set out on the
porch and mary lessing in a white frock sprang up from one of the
big basketchairs to greet us with a comical dismay
ive dragged you over here she began promptly and now ill tell
you the worst at once  there is notonelumpof sugar in the
entire house  ive looked  so either you will drink your tea
sugarless smile sweetly and say it doesnt matter or else one of
you has got to come right down to the village with me and get some
you can take your full choice about it  im glad to see you had the
thoughtfulness to drive anyway
herrick sat down with alacrity
i am a tired man he announced supposed to be on a holiday and
im not going to the village to get anything till ive had tea and
im not going to drink tea without sugar not even if you promise to
smile in the teacup mary lessing  so i guess its up to you and
haverill  and i think that after all my excellent instructions of
the past fourteen years you ought to be a better housekeeper  its
scandalous and disgusting of you  wheres dick
in the laboratory
a day like this  ill rout him out of that in just two seconds
ho dick
there was no response and he rose grumbling and trailed round to
the laboratory door  mary looked at me
do you mind she said meekly
i slipped off the mares hitchingstrap and mary climbed into the
buggy beside me  we took the road past sliefers and it is to be
admitted that i made no effort to hurry  our errand might reasonably
be supposed to take an hour and since chance had so obligingly given
me that hour i was going to make the most of it
as a matter of fact i got precious little good out of it
romance probably demands here that i should describe how mary and i
drove side by side through the mellow autumntinted woods how we
spoke of the beauty of nature around us and how gradually a sweet
sense of companionship grew up in our young and sympathetic souls
instead mary spoilt the whole thing by her hurry to get that sugar
if the life of the whole household including herrick had depended
upon it she couldnt have been more sternly anxious to get to the
village to buy that sugar and to convey that sugar swiftly and
relentlessly home  looking back i can see now that her attitude in
the matter was only part of a constraint that had been growing
between us subtly ever since herricks arrival  a certain frank
comradeship as i had been pleased to think it that had sprung into
being on the morning of our impromptu picnic had wavered and
dropped leaving nothing in its place  i could not decide that she
actually avoided me though she certainly devoted a good deal of
attention to herrick when we were all together  be that as it may
her professed anxiety on the sugar question that afternoon justly
irritated me  we began with constraint and ended in something very
like open warfare
it was probably not the first time that a perverse imp of
circumstance or call it what you will has induced two young people
who started out on apparently good terms to waste the precious
moments of each others uninterrupted company in being pointedly and
deliberately disagreeable and that for no reason that either of them
could frame  the imbecility of that drive stands out in my memory
now  we should both of us have known better  the whole thing had
begun in such a meaningless way as to have no possible excuse  we
had started as i say on good terms with every equipment for a
pleasant hour and instead we each in our own way chose to behave
abominably
after one unique and disastrous attempt at conversation i remember
we said no more but drove on side by side in a ridiculous and stony
silence each thinking how disagreeable the other was and wondering
mutually what we had ever liked in one another
there was the usual group of loafers gathered on the porch of
haskells grocery store when we reached the village  i left mary
seated in the buggy outside while i went in to buy the sugar  a
briskmannered young man with fair hair served me and it was my
fancy that he dawdled a little over making up the parcel  the
proprietor was busy near by at the time and from the sideglance the
assistant gave him i gathered that the latter was purposely
stretching out his task to gain time  i was not wrong  upon the
proprietor crossing to the back of the store where the cash register
stood the young man leaned forward across the counter
doctor he began i would like a few words with you sometime when
you arent busy
why certainly i answered  any time you like  you want advice
about something
it was almost the first time i had had occasion to go into the store
and the assistant was quite a stranger to me  i was probably known
to him by sight but i wondered at his choosing such a confidential
way to approach me if he merely wanted medical advice i kept the
same office hours as lennox had done and everyone in the village
knew where and when to find me
im george freeman he said  it wasnt advice exactly  i just
 wanted to see you
george freeman  suddenly i remembered  it was the name of rebecca
burns sweetheart the young man who had shown such decision on the
evening of the ghost scare at sliefers farm  i looked at him with
new interest
i shall be in this evening after nine oclock i said  come round
to the house  you know where it is
yes  ill be round
all right  i put down a quarter on the counter taking up the
parcel he held out to me  as i did so a step creaked behind me and i
turned quickly
aaron menning stood near us  for a second his eyes moved shiftily
from one to the other then he put up a hand to the greasy peaked cap
he wore
arternoon doctor he drawled arternoon ffreeman  gimme some
pplug terbaccer
his face was impassive and stupid but when he pushed his cap back i
noticed the veins on his temples stand out  he approached the
counter with something of a swagger his hands in the pockets of his
black oilskin coat and spat on the floor  there was something in
the movements of the man which i disliked at that moment more
intensely than ever  he had a curious shambling way when he walked
which added to his thickset figure gave me the feeling of
something half animal almost simian  it amounted to an actual
repugnance  i gave him a curt nod while i waited for my change and
lost no time in hastening out to the buggy
i put the parcel under the seat and took the reins from marys hands
curiously my mood of a few moments ago was all but forgotten as i
climbed in beside her
did the fellow say anything to you i asked her as we drove off  a
sudden suspicion had struck me when i came out and found her waiting
there
who
aaron menning
no  i just saw him go into the store
she spoke with a studied indifference that put me on the alert
instantly i was sure that he had spoken
why do you ask
i set my teeth
because if he had i answered rashly id take the occasion to
break his neck next time we meet
mary gave a soft little laugh
really doctor haverill i didnt know you were so violent
im not i retorted at least not as a rule  but the sight of
that man always rouses in me a peculiar and earnest desire to kick
him
i dare say hes really quite a simple and kindhearted man said
mary with no other purpose i felt sure than to irritate me
the rugged exterior that hides a beautiful soul i suggested
remembering that sinister farmyard beyond the bend  thats as it
may be  the exterior is good enough for me or bad enough as you
choose to put it  if i get the report of a spca inspector on
that farm of his as i intend to do one of these days well see how
aarons simple kindheartedness stands out
the words slipped out almost without my knowledge  mary looked at me
quickly
whats wrong at the place
merely that the condition of it isnt particularly pretty  i
shouldnt have mentioned it  only a man that keeps animals in the
filth and neglect that he does ought to be made an example of in any
civilized community  i dont know that theres anything to be gained
by interfering at the present moment but ive seen enough to make me
keep an eye on him
for a little time we drove in silence  marys face was grave and
troubled  i was angry with myself  i was a fool to mention menning
or his place at all  presently i turned to her
look here youre not upset by what i said just now  because youve
no need to think twice about it  i said it because  well because
i hated to hear you speak about him that way even for a minute
no  i wasnt thinking about aaron just then  she gave me a queer
little smile  doctor haverill i guess ive behaved pretty
abominably this afternoon
i flicked the mare with the whip
shall we say we both did and call it quits  i suppose it was in
the air somehow
in the air she repeated smiling again then shivered suddenly
things are in the air  thats just it  i had a dream last night
i suppose youll call it silly nonsense but its made me queer and
restless all day  doctor haverill has herrick said anything to you
about my brother yet
we talked one evening
well
we  didnt get to any conclusions thats all  he has some
theory  he hasnt told me yet what it is
she looked at me steadily
if he said that it is because he knows something  i am absolutely
certain of that  and if he knows  doctor haverill you are
keeping something back from me you and herrick together
i am not  i wouldnt do it  i looked at the girl beside me  if
you want me to swear
no  she put out a hand  yes one thing  can you swear to me
that to your knowledge there is no suspicion in his mind of any 
brain trouble with dick
yes i can swear to that absolutely
i am glad  she was looking straight ahead down the road before
us  i dont think even herrick would have kept that from me if he
thought it  well  i suppose ive got to wait
we spoke of other things during the rest of the drive and she did
not once mention herricks name or her brothers again  we were
passing sliefers place when i caught sight once of our queer little
acquaintance of the morning  he was just turning in at the gateway
his hat pulled well forward his little tin box under his arm and i
nodded to him as we drove by  he jerked his head in response
peering shortsightedly up at the buggy through his round dark
glasses
what a funny little man said mary after we had passed by  is he
staying down here
at the sliefers  herrick found him in the woods this morning  he
appears to spend his time orchidhunting in the neighbourhood
orchidhunting said mary  she turned her head and looked back
at mr crowfoot rather deliberately  following her gaze i was
surprised to see that he too had turned and was standing looking
after us from the sliefers gateway  seeing himself observed he
moved hurriedly and disappeared in the direction of the house like a
disturbed rabbit going abruptly to earth
xiv
the cry in the night
a few minutes after we reached the bungalow mrs searle appeared
she brought a letter for herrick which had come by the afternoon mail
it had a specialdelivery stamp on so i thought it might be
important she said  pete was busy so i took the liberty of
bringin it over myself  i was glad of the walk anyway
i had my own opinion of petes busyness when it came to an errand up
the hill and i tried to catch mrs searles eye but her gaze was
discreetly lowered
its awfully good of you said herrick  he slipped the envelope in
his pocket with a glance at the writing  wont you rest a minute
mrs searle  im sure miss lessing would like you to
mary was getting tea at the moment but lessing seconded him
promptly  mrs searle shook her head
ill be gettin back sir thanks just the same  theres things to
see to  its done me good to get the walk
you neednt walk back anyway i put in  id be glad for the mare
to be home and mr herrick and i can walk over later  you can
drive yourself mrs searle cant you
certainly sir if youd rather
she untied the mare and turned the buggy carefully around before
getting in  ask pete to give her a good rub down i called  mr
herrick and i will be back by suppertime
as it happened we stayed fairly late  the tea resolved itself into
a semisupper with the addition of chocolate cake canned pineapple
and sardines prepared by some special and deadly recipe of lessings
in a chafingdish  it was a combination that induced a certain
languor afterwards in soul and body  later lessing having
reengaged herrick in the game of chess that our return had
interrupted mary and i found ourselves once more left to each
others company at the far end of the porch  she had attempted some
quite ridiculous excuse about dishwashing but either the sense of
herricks near presence or the meal just finished lent me moral
courage to vanquish her objections on the spot
either you invite people to your house i said or you dont
invite them  if you do its your business to entertain them  im
not an exacting person but if it comes to contesting my rights
against those of mere crockery i warn you that im going to be
exceedingly disagreeable
our talk on the homeward drive had broken the aloofness of the past
week and i was minded not to let her slip back into it at will  she
sat down on the wicker armchair opposite me her hands folded on her
lap
would you like to see the family photograph album she suggested
we none of us collect picturepostcards so im afraid thats the
only interesting object i can offer you  or i might take you round
the garden and show you the site for next years rose bushes
i should be delighted i said ruthlessly
she made a mouth at me
i dont think you are in a mood to appreciate the exquisite
sentiment of next years rose bushes she returned  it calls for a
totally different range of sympathies from yours
i lit a cigarette
you dont know anything about my range of sympathies i remarked
for all you know they may extend to objects even more ethereal than
unborn roses
impossible  she pulled a spray off the woodbine that grew round
the porch pillar and began to pull it to pieces leaf by leaf  by
the way she said after a moment did you tell me that that queer
little friend of yours was a botanist
of herricks i corrected  i entirely disclaim him  he described
himself as an amateur whatever he may mean by that  i gather that
its his way of amusing himself on a holiday  there are a good many
people who seem to feel lost unless they have some definite hobby for
their vacations  i suppose really it gives him mild exercise and an
excuse for grubbing about in the open
he takes other mild exercise said mary her mouth curving in
sudden recollection  he was engaged in some the other morning and
thats what made me so interested  im afraid i interrupted him
youd seen him before then
she laughed
i was taking leo for a run before breakfast down the hill the
other morning and i came upon him just in the hollow there near
where the stream is and id give you a hundred dollars to guess his
occupation  i dont know if youve ever noticed a cedar there
doctor haverill growing quite near the road on the righthand side
it branches off some little way from the ground  well there he was
engaged of all things in the world in solemnly climbing up into
this tree and jumping out again  i was walking along the footpath
where the ground is soft so he never heard me coming and the
performance struck me as so interesting that i stood still for a
minute and watched him  he did it four or five times and it looked
as if he was trying to see how far he could jump  the last time he
landed quite near to the edge of the stream and that seemed to
satisfy him for he didnt try any more after that  then he looked
about on the ground and began to smooth over all the footprints hed
made  hed just finished when he caught sight of me  he had taken
his glasses off for jumping i suppose in case he smashed them and
as soon as he saw me he grabbed them out of his pocket and walked
off  it was for all the world as if he was ashamed at having been
caught doing it  i suppose it did look ridiculous for a man of his
age to go doing stunts like a schoolboy  i guess it was some sort of
an exercise and he does it pretty often for he was certainly active
at it  i thought maybe he was a physicalculture crank
a mild lunatic more like i smiled  perhaps the giddiness of
youth returns to him at times and he has to work it off  maybe its
a religious exercisesome obscure sect of jumping baptists  ill
ask him when we meet
mary laughed but her brows were drawn in a puzzled frown
do you know she said i have a conviction that i have seen that
man before  i dont know in the least why  generally i remember
people quite well  i feel that i have not only seen him but spoken
to him  a thing like that bothers me because i ought to remember
it  i will sometime
youd remember if you had spoken to him i said  he stammers
quite badly
then that settles it returned mary gaily  i have only known two
people who stammered in my whole life with the exception of aaron
menning and one was a chemistry professor at school and the other a
spinster aunt
my appointment with george freeman was at nine and it was nearly
that hour when we left the bungalow  herrick and i walked briskly
down the hill and as we passed dutchmans hollow i cast a curious
glance at the tree which had been the scene of mr crowfoots
acrobatic performances  it stood as mary had said almost
overhanging the footpath a strong twistedlimbed cedar noticeable
as being the only tree of its kind along the road  the fork was a
good six feet from the ground and i reflected that crowfoot must
possess more agility than his appearance warranted
herrick followed my glance
a queer tree that he said  looks as if it had been stuck there
for some purpose  do you ever notice haverill how some inanimate
thingsif i may call a tree inanimatestrike one unpleasantly  now
that tree to me suggests a suicide every time i look at it  a man
might hang himself among the upper branches and youd merely take
his body for a part of the tree
another horror to the mystery of dutchmans hill i said lightly
heavens sake jack but youre in a cheerful mood tonight  you
seem to have creepy things on the brain  it you stood and looked at
any tree long enough you could hypnotize yourself into seeing things
i merely called it unpleasant returned herrick argumentatively
to me it is  you think that because i have taken a fancy to dislike
a tree im ready to imagine unpleasant things about it  i believe
that if it impresses me that way for no apparent reason it is
because the unpleasant things have in all probability already
happened
oh argue that stuff with lessing i protested goodhumoredly
its more in his line  i heard you at it tonight  im a normal
man and i object to having my free imagination harrowed over things
that dont count  that tree is a tree and thats all about it
our fooling had brought us to a pause at the beginning of the little
plank bridge and herrick leaning against the rail had employed the
interval in making a cigarette  he smiled slipping his tobacco
pouch back and began to feel through his pockets for the little
automatic tinderbox he always carried  he was methodical over
trifling things to a degree that occasionally irritated me
then go up and touch it he said  i would like to test that
sensitiveness which you boast that you dont possess
all right
i walked up to the tree impatient at my own encouragement of such
nonsense and laid my hand on the trunk  almost as my fingers
touched the bark i heard distinctly a low cry cut suddenly and
horribly short  the woods especially at night are deceptive both
as to direction and distance and already halfexpectant of some
trick i could have sworn that herrick himself had done it  i
wheeled on him angrily  he was standing in the roadway the
cigarette at his lips the tiny flame of the tinderbox flickering in
his lifted hand and by its light i saw his face white and startled
did you do that
do you think im a fool  he caught my arm and swung me round
facing the woods of a sudden ominously silent  for a moment we
listened acutely  then herrick flung his unlighted cigarette away
come on  it was over there
he started forward in the direction where the dam lay breaking
through the underbrush  i followed at his heels  along the road
there had been still a glimmer of light but once under cover of the
trees we stumbled through dense blackness with nothing to guide us
save herricks vague sense of direction  once he stood still to
shout  there was no answer
follow the stream i said
we had struck the edge of it again i felt my boots sink in marshy
ground and thereafter we made quicker pace  the brook was narrow at
this time of year running a mere trickle in its bed  it branched
off from the creek just below the mill sluice and in spring carried
off some of the excess of water when the creek itself was swollen
just now as i knew there was a scant foot of water at its deepest
i was taking no particular heed therefore to my steps when herrick a
few paces to my left called out
take care he said  were nearly in the creek
as he spoke i heard somewhere near us in the darkness the
unmistakable sound of rushing water  i stopped abruptly bewildered
with the sense of having somehow lost my bearings  as we were going
the creek should have been a good hundred yards on our left
and the sound was not the sound of the creek  i had paused at the
moment near the edge of the brook i could feel soft saturated moss
underfoot and i fancied that it grew even softer and damper as i
stood  something swirled at my ankles and taking a step forward i
was kneedeep in sudden icy flood
incredible as it seemed the stream was rising  i had barely grasped
the meaning of it when herrick shouted again  this time he was
answered  a strong shout caught up the echo of his voice
hello there  where are you  it was herrick
and the answer came promptly near at hand now in the darkness
hello  by the dam  keep clear of the stream the sluicegate is
giving
xv
suspicions
the warning came just in time  herrick sang out and sprang and i
could hear the splash as he landed close beside me  together we
forced a way through the bushes and tall weeds and began to scramble
up the sloping bank  it was a thicket of alders and brambles the
briars caught and tore at our clothes as we pushed through  we came
out not far from the sluice with the rush of escaping water still in
our ears and above the turmoil of it i called again
where are you  is there something wrong
i want help here
the voice answered almost from under our feet midway down the bank
up which we had just scrambled  in a cleared space of the little
thicket a man was standing my eyes used by now to the darkness
could make out his figure outlined against the surrounding bushes
it was mr crowfoot and he was bending over something that lay
stretched and ominous among the trampled weeds at his feet  i had
not recognized his voice in the darkness though it sounded vaguely
familiar  herrick reached him first and was on his knees beside the
prostrate figure when i came up
an accident haverill  i thought so  no hes alive  how did it
happen
he must have fallen off the gate said crowfoot  in the excitement
he forgot to stammer  i heard him call out and went down after him
i had only just time to drag him out
herrick wiped his hand on the grass
cut his head open he said briefly  i think theres an arm
broken  give me a hand austin  we must get him up to the top
compound fracture and a broken collarbone said crowfoot in his
precise tones oddly precise even in this moment  im glad you
gentlemen came along  the head wound isnt much but theres
probably a slight concussion  if you will help me
it struck me that he took the mans injuries with a remarkable
coolness utterly at variance with the impression of nervousness he
had given me that morning  it was as if he were the medical man and
we mere lay beings who had happened along  herrick growled  he had
found his tinderbox and it flashed a tiny glimmer on the mans face
george freeman i exclaimed
you know him said herrick quickly
the sweetheart of that girl at sliefers  he had an appointment
with me this evening  he must have been on his way
i stopped short  i thought crowfoot gave a faint exclamation but he
said nothing  together we got the limp figure to the roadway at the
top of the bank and laid him down  herrick turned to crowfoot
was he with you
no  i was walking along the side of the dam  i often take a stroll
of an evening i sleep rather badly without  he was lying at the
bottom of the sluicegate when i found him half in the water and i
dragged him out  i supposed he had missed his footing in the dark
and cried out as he fell
herrick and i exchanged glances  so far the story might be true we
had both heard the cry
isnt there a railing herrick asked
it was broken said crowfoot and has never been properly
repaired  i have spoken about it several times at the farm but mr
sliefer has neglected to mend it
thats so i confirmed  its been broken a good three weeks
hardly anyone passes this way now the mill isnt working so i
suppose they havent bothered
well said herrick  he rose from his knees  as hes known at
the farm hed better be taken there  he must be properly moved  we
cant handle him like this
ill go and get help said crowfoot
herrick looked at him squarely
i prefer that we should go together he said drily  austin do
you mind staying here for ten minutes  i suppose you havent your
revolver
i hadnt  i carried one usually in accordance with lessings
suggestion but at this moment it was locked in one of the surgery
drawers
never mind i said  i dont need it
mr crowfoot hesitated  then his hand slipped to his pocket
herrick had been cleverer than i gave him credit for
if you allow me doctor haverill he said gravely i will leave
you my own  i should much prefer it  we are two and it would be
better that you should not remain here unarmed
again herrick and i glanced at one another
do you usually carry a revolver when you take your evening strolls
mr crowfoot he asked
it is a precaution replied the little botanist which i consider
to be quite harmless  as you put a similar question to your friend
just now i presume the habit is not confined to myself
take it said herrick curtly  well be back in a quarter of an
hour  and he disappeared with crowfoot along the path toward
sliefers farm
left alone my first and perhaps pardonable impulse was to examine
the chambers of the revolver mr crowfoot had just given me  one of
the cartridges had been discharged  i slipped it back into my jacket
pocket where it would be ready to hand and took out my cigarette
case  there was nothing to be done for the man beside me until
further help arrived  i reassured myself as to his condition  it
was as crowfoot had said  the head wound had bled freely but we had
already partially stanched it with herricks handkerchief  the right
arm and shoulder were fractured and i suspected a rib as well  he
could not have fallen directly from the sluicegate but from one
side with the bushes and the water to break his fall  if he had
struck one of the heavy timbers immediately below he would have had
his back broken on the spot  as it was he was in no immediate
danger unless from a concussion the extent of which we could not as
yet ascertain
i sat down on the beam which marked the beginning of the sluicewall
and fell to thinking  the thing had not to me entirely the look of
an accident  crowfoot on a moments consideration and in spite of
the empty cartridge i exonerated  freeman had not been shot and
crowfoot could have had no object in pushing him over only to rescue
him afterwards and undoubtedly he had saved his life  possibly they
had quarrelled and freeman had lost his footing which would account
for crowfoots prompt action  crowfoot was staying at the sliefers
in the same house with freemans sweetheart and where a young woman
like rebecca is concerned there is always a possibility of
misunderstandings but the idea of little crowfoot playing the rustic
don juan seemed rather absurd  and that question of the sluicegate
worried me  it had been a dry season the water in the dam was even
lower than usual there was no earthly reason why the gate should
give way just then with no extra pressure to account for it
sitting on the wall swinging my feet with the sound of the water in
my ears i found myself listening mechanically to its rush  suddenly
a thought occurred to me  there had been no increase in the volume
of sound since i had been sitting there  if the sluicegate had
given way only in part the force of the escaping water would by this
time have widened the fissure
i rose and walked the few paces to the top of the gate
it was as i thought  the lever that controlled the sluice had been
pulled half over  bracing my feet firmly i threw all my strength
against it  i had the force of the water to contend with as i
pushed the whole neglected structure of the gate seemed to vibrate
and tremble but little by little i could hear the gush gradually
decreasing the seething and bubbling below me quieted
i pushed the lever back as far as i could it refused to go the whole
way and i feared to do further damage unwittingly by forcing it
but the greater part of the escape was checked  i went back to the
wall again and waited
the minutes dragged  it was a relief to see presently the glimmer of
a light through the trees and to hear mr sliefers anxious
deepthroated hail  they had taken one of the stable doors off its
hinges and herrick and the farmer carried it between them while
crowfoot walked ahead with the lantern
i saw crowfoot glance toward the sluice but he said nothing  with
as little jarring as might be we lifted freemans unconscious weight
on to the door and i took herricks place in the slow procession
back to the farmhouse
mrs sliefer with rebecca whitefaced and stricken met us in the
yard  they had prepared a room upstairs and there we got freeman to
bed and did all that was possible for him  unconsciousness spared
him the pain of our handling the fracture was as ugly a one as i
have seen  the concussion was graver even than we had supposed it
would be days certainly possibly weeks before he would be in a
state to answer any questions
i decided to stay the night and herrick with the sleifers hired
man drove over in the buggy to take a message to mrs searle and
bring back what was needful from the surgery
in his absence i set myself to gather what information i could from
the sliefers themselves  george freeman had been there that evening
he had arrived earlier than usual it being his weekly evening off
and stayed only a short time saying that he had an appointment in
the village  on rebecca teasing him he had said that it was a
business appointment and that she should hear all about it in good
time
he had left the house at a quarterpast eight  his appointment was
for nine and it would have taken him nearly that time to walk over
even by the short cut  it was already close upon nine when we left
the lessings cottage to walk home and at least twenty minutes must
have elapsed before we heard freemans cry  how had he employed that
interval and with what object had he lingered nearly threequarters
of an hour near the dam  instinctively i thought of crowfoot  he
was not in the room and in the light of what had happened i felt no
hesitation in questioning the sliefers about their guest
he had come to them a fortnight ago engaging his room by letter
they often took a boarder in the summer and someone who once stayed
there had recommended them to him  he was quiet and
pleasantmannered and anxious to give no trouble an ideal boarder
from mrs sliefers point of view though rebecca inclined to
consider him queer  he had stipulated for a groundfloor room
explaining that for some heart affection he was forbidden to mount
stairs  i smiled thinking of the acrobatic exercises mary lessing
had witnessed  they had accordingly arranged the back parlor for
him which had a door opening directly on the side porch  his meals
were served to him there  beyond the necessary service they had very
little to do with him  he was not at all talkative on account of his
infirmity but always pleasant in manner  to their knowledge george
freeman had never so much as spoken to him though it was his
unfailing joke to tease rebecca about the handsome young city
gentleman
so much for mr and mrs sliefers account  rebecca differed
rebecca didnt hold with queerness nor with mucking ones room up
with rubbishy weeds nor with going out at night to hunt toadstools
toadstools i said
fungy he calls em  its the same thing  he says theres some
that shines in the dark like rotten wood  ive never seen em nor
i wouldnt go touchin em if i did  anything would need to shine
good and hard for him to see it with those blue goggles on
rebeccas jest set against him because he wears glasses said mrs
sliefer
i like to see a folks eyes rebecca insisted  i hate to have em
lookin at you when you think they aint
for some reason she seemed to distrust crowfoot but there was
certainly no suspicion even in her mind of any possible quarrel
between the two men  rebecca herself admitted his courage in having
pulled freeman out  no mention was made of the sluice and i
concluded that neither herrick nor crowfoot had spoken of it at the
house
mrs sliefer volunteered to sit up with freeman the first part of the
night and having seen her settled in a capacious armchair near his
bed i returned to herrick in the parlor below  there was a couch in
the room but we were neither inclined to make use of it  it was my
first chance of speaking privately to herrick since his return to the
house and having closed the staircase door leading upstairs i told
him briefly all that i had learned that evening
crowfoot couldnt have opened the sluice he said when i had
finished  how does the thing work  do you suppose freeman could
have caught at the lever as he fell and pulled it over on him  it
doesnt sound likely
impossible  the lever works in the opposite direction
herrick pondered
he might have been fooling with the thing and opened it and then
lost his balance trying to get it back
i shook my head
he knows the dam well enough and he doesnt strike me as the sort
of man to go fooling with a thing like that out of mischief
besides he didnt fall from where the lever is  if he had and the
sluice was already open hed have been soaked through and probably
drowned to boot  remember the rush of that water  crowfoot got him
out and crowfoot was only wet to the knees  he must have fallen
partially clear of the pool across one of the timbers  the thing
looks much more to me as though someone had deliberately opened the
sluice on them while they were both down there  either the machinery
stuck or they were interrupted before they could do the worst  in
any case crowfoot knows more than he has chosen to tell us  he may
be shielding someone the whole business looks ugly
im going to handle crowfoot in the morning said herrick grimly
its a case where hell find it best to tell all he knows  a man
who goes hunting toadstools at night with a revolver lays himself
open to misconstruction  he stared a moment at the purple crocheted
mat on which the sleifers parlor lamp sat enthroned  why on earth
was he so keen on your keeping that revolver i wonder
possibly for the same reason that had caused him to fire one of the
cartridges himself this evening i said drily
he had herrick looked up  why didnt we hear the shot
it happens to be one of those special revolvers which are built to
make as slight a report as possible  i know the pattern  the sound
carries practically no distance  if crowfoot carries that revolver
habitually it is because he has good reason to be afraid of someone
and he wouldnt have used it without serious cause
have you any idea asked herrick what freeman wanted to see you
about tonight
yes i said slowly i have  you know the night you came down
here jack  it was freeman who was the most determined to sift that
ghost story to the bottom if you remember  from all accounts he is
not the young man to take halfway measures in a thing that concerns
his sweetheart  i think that he has been working on his own
initiative that he found out something and it was about that that
he wanted to see me  he made the appointment for after dark at an
hour when he was not likely to be seen coming or going from my house
and he even took the precaution of coming by way of the woods
someone had an interest in preventing him from keeping the
appointment  they watched him to the sliefers house and laid up
for him by the sluice which he would have to cross on his way to me
you mean crowfoot himself
crowfoot wasnt here at the time of the ghost scare and he didnt
know of freemans appointment tonight  moreover i dont think he
had even an idea who the man was till you flashed your lamp on him
remember it was pretty dark there  but two people might have known
of it  they were both in the store at the time  one was mr
haskell whom i think we may dismiss immediately  the other was
aaron menning
aaron menning  there was that in herricks tone that confirmed
instantly my own conclusions  then if thats so aaron menning is
at the bottom of the ghost business and of the whole dutchmans hill
story  aaron the pious chapel member  but why in heavens
name
theres a streak of insanity in the whole family i said  dont
forget that jakey was said to be half crazy  aaron has the look of a
criminal degenerate  how on earth he has maintained his reputation
in the village so long i cant think  he is cunning and malicious
if no worse
id like to know just what hold that type of man could have over
crowfoot herrick said  crowfoot comes in somewhere  if it was
aaron pushed freeman over what reason could crowfoot have for
shielding him deliberately  theres more behind it yet than we can
lay hand on
there was but our plans for finding out were destined to receive a
rude shock in the morning
about two oclock i left herrick on the couch and went to take mrs
sliefers place upstairs  against my will i half dozed in the
chintzcovered armchair and through my brain there chased puzzling
dreams in which herrick and i were trying feverishly to conceal
george freemans body in the milldam while crowfoot continually
changing and rechanging into the likeness of aaron leapt up and down
from the dizzy heights of a butternut tree and chattered at us
angrily as he sprang
herrick was already drinking coffee when i came downstairs  rebecca
had brought it in and with it a note addressed to me
i broke it open  there was a second bulkier envelope inside with the
note  both note and address were printed in small neat capitals
such as a child might use
my dear haverill
i regret that i have been obliged to leave for the city by an early
train and so must postpone the pleasure of meeting you and your
friend again till a later date
alexander crowfoot
on the second envelope was printed
to be opened only if not reclaimed within three days
stung said herrick
xvi
i catch a burglar
i found rebecca in the kitchen weeping  it was easy to see that she
had spent half the night crying and i hastened to reassure her so
far as i could as to her sweethearts condition
and now about mr crowfoot i said  what time did he leave here
it must have been early rebecca answered  i was down an about
by five
he gave you the note
he left it in his room  i went to put his coffee like i always do
outside an the door was open  he left another envelope for mother
with his weeks board in  his bed hadnt been slept in  he was
writin in his room all last evenin after he came in
and his things
he didnt have moren a suitcase and he must have took that with
him
i went back to herrick in the parlour  crowfoots enclosure still
lay on the table and as i took it up to put it in my pocket i felt
sorely tempted to break the seal there and then
so hes lit out temporarily said herrick  well  it doesnt
look particularly wise under the circumstances but i suppose he
knows his own business
should we open the letter
no herrick said decidedly  that point is quite clear  the
instructions are definite  he gives us a certain date and if he
does not reclaim his letter personally by then we are free to act on
our discretion but not before  meantime we can only put two and two
together  crowfoot was down here on some job in which he anticipated
personal danger or he wouldnt have gone armed  the cartridge he
used was not fired on freeman and unless i am much mistaken the
affair of last night upset or at all events abruptly altered his
own schemes  hes learned something that we havent and id give a
good deal to know just what but we cant force his hand  unless i
underestimate him hell turn up to claim that letter all right
unless i recalled the provisional clause on the envelope
herrick smiled
he doesnt strike me as the sort of person to step off a plank
bridge in the dark  thats a pure bit of dramatic effect in my
opinion
when we had finished breakfast i drove down to the drug store and
telephoned for a trained nurse  she arrived by the midday train and
freemans condition being satisfactory i was able to leave him in
her charge and go home with herrick
we refused the farmers buggy and walked over following the short
cut that had so nearly proved fatal to one man at least the night
before  the water below the sluicegate was at its normal level but
looking over we could see the line of uptorn weeds and flattened
grasses that showed where the brief flood had swept  an alder bush
on the left side overhanging the timbered edge of the pool was
partly broken indicating the point of freemans fall
we examined the upper part of the sluicegate carefully  on the wood
near the lever i found a few dried spots of blood  herrick nodded
appreciatively when he saw them
looks as if crowfoots cartridge wasnt wasted  someone got hit
though not badly theres none tracked along the road  my respect
for our friend increases  austin why was he so careful we didnt
see his handwriting
give it up  hes a queer bird anyway
i told him of what mary lessing had seen that morning by dutchmans
hill  hitherto it had presented itself to me merely as a whim on
crowfoots part  now i began to think he might have had some object
in the performance  herrick smiled when it came to the jumping but
his face grew serious again immediately
austin he said i give you a problem  what is it about that
particular tree that attracts me and attracts crowfoot  theres
something more than coincidence in it  crowfoot wasnt amusing
himself  to my mind he was testing a theory and if we knew what
that theory was  he broke off thoughtfully and i turned to him
well
nothing much  austin whereabouts was jakes body found last
spring
face downwards in the water just near the plank bridge  why
taken with crowfoots action does that suggest anything to you
nothing to do with suicide  jake had a fit and fell in the water
exactly  he walked a few paces in silence  has it ever occurred
to you what a really admirable country coroner you would make
i dont see what thats got to do with it
listen  he swung round  jakes death was not accident though he
may have died actually in a fit  he was frightened by someone or
something that sprang out at him from that tree as he passed and
crowfoot depend upon it was merely trying to find out whether that
jump was within the limits of an ordinarily active man
we were both tired that evening and we turned in early after supper
i had left instructions to call me if there was any change in
freemans condition but i anticipated none before the morning  the
nurse seemed a competent woman and i felt easy in leaving him to her
care  i slept like a log my rest untroubled by any dreams
towards morning as it seemed to me i woke up with that curious
sense of something happening which arouses one at times by appeal
through some subconscious perception  five minutes before a
thunderstorm would have failed to rouse me now instinct dragged me
up sitting in my bed of a sudden keenly and alertly awake
i listened  someone was moving in the surgery below  mrs searle
went to bed always at ten and i had the impression of having slept
already for several hours  i struck a match softly and looked at my
watch  it was a quarter to twelve earlier than i had thought  i
felt on the bureau for my revolver which i had taken to my room that
evening and opened the door noiselessly
it was not herrick for i could hear his regular breathing through
the keyhole opposite  at the foot of the little flight of stairs a
faint light glimmered  the stairs opened directly from the surgery
and it was my custom to leave the door at the bottom open during the
night  now it was closed and the light that i saw filtered through
the crack  i crept quietly down and pushed it open revolver in hand
a pocket electric lamp lay on the desk and by its light a man was
searching through one of the desk drawers  it was a small drawer
which had been always locked i fancied that it contained some
private papers and affairs of lennoxs which he had put together
there before leaving  the mans back was towards me but i
recognized instantly the shabby tweed coat the soft felt hat pulled
low down over his head  it was crowfoot
i dont know what i had expected certainly not him  i lowered the
revolver and stepped forward
were you looking for anything mr crowfoot
at the sound of my voice he turned his hand shot out towards the
electric lamp and instantly the room was in darkness
for a second we stood there neither moving and we could hear each
others breathing across the room
light that lamp i said quietly  if you have any explanation i am
ready to hear it  i have a revolver in my hand and if you attempt
to move i shall be compelled to treat you like any other common
housebreaker
listen here he began and dont for heavens sake play the fool
his voice sounded excited impatient but with an assurance in it
that was somehow vaguely familiar to me and as on the night before
there was no trace of his usual stammering  it was the voice of a
man interrupted in important business rather than caught redhanded
in an attempt at common theft  put that revolver down haverill  i
tell you you dont know what youre meddling with  im in a hurry
let me go out of the house now without any questions and i swear to
heaven ill come back tomorrow and tell you everything you want to
know  ill tell you everything  but dont stop me now
you will eh
i laid the revolver down on a chair that stood behind me but only to
have both hands free  he made a movement chancing the darkness but
the room was too small  i collided with him somewhere near the
armchairthe solid mahogany caught my knee an ugly whack through my
thin pajamasand for a moment we grappled together fruitlessly
haverill you idiotlet me go
he gasped and struggled but i held my grip
not so easy  i want the lamp
he swore wrenching an arm free and the little white bulb glowed
out  he must have slipped it in his pocket when he turned  the
light shone on our two blinking faces  crowfoots hat had fallen off
in the struggle and for the first time i saw him without his black
glasses
it was lennox
stupefied i let go my hold
now will you let me go he snarled
i thought you were in europe  whats it all about  are you crazy
oh you idiot  there was a savage patience in his voice  get on
your trousers then and come along  you were always an obstinate
devil haverill  bring that revolver with you and dont wake the
house and dont for gods sake stand wasting any more time  ill
wait for you
i ran upstairs  a hundred wild ideas passed through my mind as i
groped my way hurriedly into sweater and trousers in the dark not
even staying to light a candle  i hardly knew in my bewilderment
whether lennox had been impersonating crowfoot or crowfoot lennox
the whole thing seemed inextricably and extravagantly mixed
curiously herrick had not even been roused by our scuffle  i
carried my boots down to avoid waking him now and pulled them on in
the surgery
take your revolver said lennox
we passed out through the door he had used his own latchkey to come
in with
will you tell me i began when we were clear of the house
all in good time
a few paces up the road an automobile was standing  two men were
already seated in it besides the chauffeur  one leaned out
watching and he gave an exclamation as the two of us stepped into
the light of the lamps
its all right said lennox  he almost pushed me into the tonneau
where i tumbled into a big broadshouldered irishman and swung up
himself to the front seat  this is doctor haverill hes coming
along  haverill this is mr keary the county sheriff and
inspector mcwade
the chauffeur let in the clutch and the big car swung forward in the
direction of dutchmans hill
and now haverill lennox said turning to me you wanted to be in
it and youre in it  these gentlemen are accompanying me to the
bend with a warrant for the arrest of the man known as aaron menning
ah  i looked at the burly irish inspector beside me and the
conviction of yesterday grew clear in my mind  for assault on
george freeman
no said the sheriff speaking for the first time  for the
manslaughter of his brother on the seventeenth of last march
xvii
a midnight chase
we swept on at a steady pace through a silence broken only by the
throbbing of the engine and the hissing whir of tires over the dust
on either side of the road the woods stretched black and inscrutable
just before we came to dutchmans hill lennox said a word to the
chauffeur and he paused to extinguish the two headlights
thereafter we drove more slowly
a few paces beyond the bridge at the beginning of the hill the car
stopped suddenly  something had gone wrong with the engine and
while the chauffeur got out to attend to it lennox and the sheriff
took the opportunity to walk back to the bridge we had just crossed
have to get a light on it the chauffeur said unhooking one of the
side lamps  the blame thing might have held out a bit longer  we
aint far from dutchmans hill by all accounts
this is dutchmans hill i said
it is eh  he glanced at the inspector who was holding the lamp
for him  well they say one cuss leads to another and be darned if
i dont give this place a worse name than its had yet
alone in the car i leaned back against the cushions speculating as
to the chance that had drawn me into this midnight adventure and what
its outcome would bethe climax for aught i knew of all the
summers mysteries  of lennoxs part in it i could but guess but
the experience of the last fortyeight hours gave me a confidence in
him that overrode all earlier impressions  mentally i contrasted the
vision of crowfoot alert coolheaded decisive with the lennox of
my first evenings arrival and marvelled at the grip he had brought
to bear on himself in the two months interval
the air was still and oppressive in the hollow the stench of
gasoline rose in a warm reek mingled with the stagnant smell of the
swamp close by  the mosquitoes were thick they descended in swarms
upon us with the stopping of the car and a host of moths and midges
fluttered round the lamp attracted by its glare  the two men bent
over the engine joked and grumbled in undertones as cheerfully as
though we were out on no more serious errand than a mere pleasure
ride
the sheriff rejoined us
how long will you be jackson
the chauffeur straightened his back
twenty minutes sir more or less  i cant fix it under
there was a brief consultation and the sheriff turned to lennox
how far are we from the bend
threequarters of a mile by road  we can strike a short cut at the
top of the hill
wed better walk it  theres no good wasting time  get your job
through jackson bring the car on to the top of the hill and wait
for us there along the road  i suppose
lennox caught my eye
i can rely on doctor haverill he said promptly  as we are one
man short already i dont think it advisable that we should divide
very good  have either of you gentlemen an extra revolver
i pulled mine out and gave it to the chauffeur  he grinned
cheerfully as he slipped it in his pocket
right sir  if any spook puts a game on me i wont start tellin my
beads  give me twenty minutes mr keary and ill have the car
right there
we left him at his task and set off up the hill following the little
footpath at the side of the road lennox and the sheriff in front
the inspector and myself at the rear  when we were nearly at the top
the inspector paused
theres fire somewhere he said  i can smell it
someone been burning bush most likely said lennox  we can tell
further on
at the top of the hill it was unmistakable a sickly charred odor
that hung heavily on the air  lennox gave an exclamation and
quickened his pace involuntarily  a moment later the lessing
bungalow came in sight there were lights in the windows and i
caught sight of a slim shawlwrapped figure on the porch  lennox and
the sheriff were well ahead and as they reached the bungalow someone
stepped out and joined them in the roadway  i heard lessings voice
raised in amazement  lennox by all thats holy
its mennings place said lennox as we came up  i thought as
much  the games up
burned to tinder an hour ago said lessing cheerfully  hello
haverill  have you all joined the local firebrigade  he caught
sight of the inspectors square shoulders behind me and whistled
so thats it  well if youre wanting an interview with menning i
guess his present address is somewhere in the woods between here and
coopersville
we ran on hastily to the bend taking a short cut across the fields
behind the bungalow  it was as lessing had said  the fire had
broken out some three hours ago and his first intimation had been
the sudden lurid glare across the treetops as he sat on the porch
smoking a final cigarette before turning in  the house a
dilapidated structure at best had caught from the basement upward
and by the time he arrived on the scene it was already beyond hope of
saving  he had given what help he could to the neighbours hastily
